does anyone know the price correlation of HK stock to that of NYSE? How’s the conversion like?,0
"@jasmysking  I think Americans as a whole take the low road with china because of all the negative propaganda. If you have actually lived in China, China has always taken an iron fist to these firms for their unscrupulous practices  when it comes to these lesser scrupulous companies and they take advantage of their customers, which china is desperately trying to change(common prosperity).. only a handful of companies have their customers best interest in mind.  While you may mock  the common prosperity aspect of the CCP policy its actually a shift to uphold some standard of social responsibility. the CCP is ultimately responsible for  protecting the outside world from Chinas growing pains. Easy to see the CCP as evil but is actually trying tame the dragon while trying its best to protect the world from it.",0

"BABA will not delist   Please do your own due diligence and look into the Chinese economy as a whole and make valid and sound arguments against these overused ""delisting"" FUD. Delisting benefits NO ONE and I don't get why people are making such a big fuss about it. If BABA is just a stock for you to make quick money without you understanding the concepts behind it, I think you are better off selling because your mental health will suffer. Otherwise, let's just chill, HODL and wait for our rewards :)",0

They could buy back up to 75 million shares at this level if they wanted to. Pretty sure they did buybacks in October that moved the market $35. They have a month left to get it done. Maybe next week. Seems to be their pattern..,0

"Had gone long (via leaps) for the longest time on  (May - Oct)  Gave up in October and shorted it was between $175 and $180.   Shorting was always the play since November last year. But I got too caught up in it being a value trap, underestimating the geopolitical factors and everything else surrounding it.  I just covered when it almost broke $125 moments ago. I see limited downside but if Nasdaq gives way, then this might go much lower.  Good luck to all the bulls. You've been through hell (like I did for 5 months).",1

This is just an accumulations and options game from the big boys and we’re stuck in the ride.    Wait for the huge rise on the first fund to cover",0
guarantee you the own Chinese government is behind this to strike fear into the west so they can buy as many shares as possible as cheap as possible and soon as Chinese government is satisfied and have reached a full position is when they will let this rise back up. Joke is on the USA 🤡,0

so much manipulation…baba is the best value stock on the planet at this discounted level. 5 or 3 years from now everyone who reads this and didn’t buy will regret it.

"Thank goodness I sold my Leaps back when BABA was at $165. But still very red on my shares. This has to be one of the most unusual things I’ve seen in the stock market. You would think after a 50% decline from $320, the selling would be done, but apparently not. Longest, deepest sell off for such a healthy company that I’ve ever seen. Maybe Apple FUD back in 2012-13 was similar",0

Chinese stock market is going to lose 80 percent from all time highs and there is nothing any retail investors can do about it. This is global payback for Covid. The economies are intertwined but when you get zero investment dollars from the rest of the world your growth is over. The Chinese invest very little in their markets except for real estate it makes up almost 40 percent of their economy. We have seen how that turned out with evergrande China changed the one baby policy and they are having less babies now then ever. They have a very old population and a shrinking young population. The great communist experiment in China is going to end very badly just like every other country that has tried it before and they are taking a few American investors with it.,1

Looking to break below 120 today,1
"what are concerned about really? 1) there is no intention of delisting as per Chinese regulators 2) any further restrictions on VIE structures would most likely only apply to new IPO's, but not traded companies. 3) even if a sole US listing would be restricted for Chinese ADRs, companies would likely be allowed a dual-listing in US and HK. 4) Even if a dual-listing is restricted, the Chinese ADR would continue to trade in HK.

You know what I find the most perplexing out of the entire debacle with regarding Chinese FUD: It’s the fact that the Chinese government itself has made it clear time and time again that they wish to do business with the world. And that China welcomes foreign investors with “open arms”. Yet the average investor would rather listen to high school drop-outs writing articles for Seeking Alpha from the basement of their mothers homes. See you at $450.00,0

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday announced its final plan for putting in place a new law that mandates foreign companies open their books to U.S. scrutiny or risk being kicked off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq within three years. China and Hong Kong are the only two jurisdictions that refuse to allow the inspections despite Washington requiring them since 2002.,1
rage buying is a terrible idea. Digging a deeper hole. Do you really want to have your money tied up in Hong Kong shares for years?,1
the absolute epi-center for intellectual property theft from entrepreneurs in America is Alibaba's TaoBao. Short this crap. SHORT IT!,1
US Regulators Move Step Closer to Delisting Chinese Companies,1
reading these posts you can tell how little people understand about de-listing and what it means. At worst they have till 2024.,0
drop $10 today. Please and thank you,1
52 week low,0
There's no new news on US delisting Chinese companies aside from the rules stated in September that companies need comply with audit requirements by 2024.  Stop with the FUD,0
And China could take over Hong Kong.  No good,1
"they want US capital, shares will just convert OTC or into HK shares. ""GoInG tO ZeRO""... novices.",0
"CHINA!! DELISTING!!! Short BABA. FFS when will this bullshit ever end. Alibaba is not likely to be delisted, and this is at least 3 years away, but we take an immediate 3 dollar hit and it stays there.",0
$50 by january,1
it does not impact baba hopefully …,0
I kind of wanna buy now but I’ll wait til $100,0
going towards $86,1
What y’all seen in this company is beyond me.,1
"bears, we got the news the 50th time already about delisting but Thanks.",0
If delisted it goes to $40 a share….yikes.,1
to $100 we go! Cheers,0
told you 100$ coming lol,1
i have a 155 average and I feel shitty.  I cant imagine the peeps in the mid and upper 200s.  Its okay retiring sounds lame anyways.  I want to work until im 90 🙃,0

lotto $100 puts 12/10,1
Covered my short on  at $120  Waiting for a few days to see if it can pump a little so that I can short this sucker to under $100,1
Now bulls look at how much it drops everyday as a victory.  Oh only down 2% 3%. Etc.    that is one way at looking at the glass half full or empty,1
"bulls, just assume it will go to 0 and don't overthink it.",0
Thousands of stocks to invest your money and this is your choice ? 🤪,1
22 rsi on the daily.... wow,1
daily 3% down. That way in 30 days it's easily affordable,1
120  imagine US has the ball to delist Chinese stock,0
Chinese stocks just bring the whole market down.  Get rid of them,1
I've finally figured out the play here. Baba will continue to drill until the earth's core. Once it passes through the core it will be an American company and get p/e ratio similar to Amazon then we can finally see baba nearing 1k.,0
120 buy will be lengendary,0
I will keep buying. Good long term.,0
it say s that IF a foreign company doesn't comply in 3 consecutive years it CAN be delisted... It s a massive manipulation!,0
taking Jan 120 calls here. Higher risk.,0
amc gonna be worth more hahaah,1
"$60 next year or not listed, your pick!",1
100 tmrw most likely I love baba but gonna wait for it to settle I don't personally believe gonna be delisted at 100 n under best buy for LT,0
continuation of the decline to 90 or 88,1
remember today is the last day you can buy and sell alibaba shares.,1
I am sure all these delisting news are just smoke in the face to justify the methodical dumping without making it too obvious since everyone with enough inside knowledge are aware of impeding Taiwan invasion. What do you think will happen with Chinese companies on the stock market when that happens?,1
"you’re freaking idiots not selling this thing. It’s going double digits January easy . Charlie Munger please, drooling old fool a walking cadaver hasn’t been right since the 1960s when he stop living.",1
puts at 50% profit already,1
Chinese stocks are the best one to short. They get their ass kick a home by Xi Jinping and abroad from the investors that don't like what Xi is doing.,1
"If you want the actual clarifications rather than the FUD spin, you can find them at this link. I‘m quoted in here several times!  This is great news! It clarifies that nothing will happen without a long and clear path to an entity’s potential delisting. it does mention VIEs are included in the regulation, but investors will be directly notified of any updates or non compliance. Also, it will be 3 years of non-compliance and a list of actual non-compliant companies and their number of years in noncompliance will be listed on PCAOB website.",0
you will never see this again above$100,1
"squeeze coming from HK , they are buying the dip !",0
1..5 years from now. Don't listen to the paid Communist shills. Vote for Freedom. Short this pig.,1
if China Delist BABA from stock exchange it will come down crashing to $0.  Tread carefully.,1

I will streaming eating poo if baba gets delisted,0
So sick of this company!  I hope it goes to 0! Never again will I invest in a Chinese company!,1
@hiteshnawani it is my understanding that  complies with the audits already as PWC I believe is the company that audits. However China not “allowing the SEC FULL access to the audits” is the devil in the details here.   It’s still all posturing between Beijing and Washington. We all need each other in this—the US needs goods and products from China and they need investment capital.   Not to mention that companies have 3 years to comply with the law so there’s a lot of time before anything happens here.   The timing of this at the bottom of the market just looks suspicious to me and like a last ditch FUD effort from MM’s.,0
$0 when it gets delisted by the CCP,1
"Selling volume vanished, this will have an epic run",0
bring me some below 100$. I will load the boat if I get it lol. If not I will invest in something else,0
probably it’s gonna be $100 or $80 by end of year,1
@JaredTyndall    Retail investors only read headlines. Here is the real release. It’s clarity. That’s good news.,0
Setting up for a short squeeze.  China has no interest in delisting and losing access to US dollars.  They will however use this as leverage to renegotiate tariffs and trade agreements.,0
everyday it going down mostly $100 soon,1
I had this pegged for $119 today - came close but there's still time....,1
— shorted this at 170 … and called a retard.   Love it,1
"Short until sub $50’s; might take a year, but it’s coming",1
have regulators actually moved closer to delisting Chinese stocks? Can’t find proof that there actually has been today or if Reuters is just trying to push the price lower,0
The sooner they delist Chinese companies the better for the stock market in the U.S,1
chinese fraud destroys healthy growth 🤦‍♂️,1
"just bought 1000 shares, PE ratio is 17!! BABA at this prices is a steal.. oversold on all indicators, big boys has been accumulating and whales spreading FUD to accumulate more, even if Chinese stocks was delisted you can still trade it in OTC, no worries on all aspects.. LONG BABA ❤️",0
this is max fear. Only matter of time before people realize all this fear mongering is fud. Delisting is not happening. Alibaba has already publicly stated they will be able to meet accounting standards. As for the chinese they would not delist because it would permanently deter foreign investment which would be economic suicide. Thus them excluding the current vie structures in place from a ban.,0
this closed at $126 USd in HK. Americans don’t know how to buy value. They like to spend spend spend. Top dollar,0
buy fear and sell greed,0
"1000% growth potential, baba is going no where",0
"Bloomberg says SEC is taking steps to delisting Chinese VIE. It doesn't matter if it's true or not, what matters is the price action of the stock and the stock's reaction. Chart doesn't lie.",1
you new bears it hit 119. You’re very late. And old bears you secured profits a long time ago stop playing,0
China can’t afford to delist from us exchanges. It will lead to wars,0
please go back under $120 I need more shares,0
china will retaliate Sec rule.,1
"Told you guys to get out in the 140s, it's Going to crash!",1
"Pussies don't forget!! ""As of the end of November, China owned US$1.063 trillion of the total outstanding US government debt issued by the US Department of the Treasury."" These aren't stupid fake news written by Bloomberg ect... for retarded people.  Thinking that Chinese don't have a plan and would burn their biggest companies is for empty retarded brains.",0
going to $90,1
"This should be 200+. Fuck the USA scum, China is lit.",0
"Wow, 130 calls for tomorrow got down to like 3-4$ Wish I would have saw that earlier. Possible 1000%+ return",0
sounds like a solid company to me. I’d buy the dip. Today and tomorrow. Until it hits $20 just buy the dip. Literally can’t go tits up 🤦‍♂️,1
"Looking strong, 10 % run tomorrow",0
i'm just asking for +0.01% at this point lol,0
All you need is one bad news or one covid case to steal his/her shares  Emotional traders in America 🇺🇸,0
No reason to spam delist 2024 concerns. BABA is dual listed. The float will merge / convert with HK 9988 listing; shares won't plummet nor go to zero  even with delist. Their revenue / earnings doesn't even rely on US consumer markets.  BABA is attractive compared to other Hang Seng valuations.,0
Every day you take a look to see how great your communists company is doing!,1
- this is just ETFs which give it the short upward price actions. Everybody shorting afterwards and selling. Don't be a fool,1

ignore the FUD.  Plain and simple this is so undervalued.  Who cares if you hold for 10 years.. you’ll 10x east.  100% annual return.  Sounds good,0
thankfully there are opportunistic investors with a long term view who picked up circa 30 m shares today.,0
I feel how many people rooting for baba rn… we need a green close.,0

I saw an alibaba as on YouTube. It sucked,1
see you in 6 months...,0
keep buying the dip down to $30,1
time for at least a 15%/20% rebound,0
Everyone knows this is getting delisted. The Chinese view cloud as national security baba has a cloud business they will never let US auditors in. Game over,1
"Will not be touching this until the delisting fears pass - Once the SEC confirms whether they will be forced to delist BABA or not, there will be one big reaction (either up or down) and then nothing but green afterwards (normal growth again)",0
"Sold $100-$110 puts months out and if get assigned I'd consider myself lucky.   Bears gambling at these levels, but if they want to gamble, thanks for the premium.",0
lmao pretty sure this could move BABA,0
It’s only bad news if the audit proves cooked books. Doesn’t mean all of China is delisted lmao,0
117.83 critical area,0
Fasten your seatbealts and enjoy the Friday. Didi delisting puts now the final pressure until official delisting will come. Sorry longs.,1
let’s make Charlie munger panic sell,1
"if BABA delist itself from New York, they need to pay 215 at least. Otherwise, they will get their ass burn by SEC",0
PreOpening in HK is higher in HKD than our close. LOL,0
"Why do you think delist is such an issue? It's not like Didi shares will go to zero. They just move to HK exchange.  Honestly if BABA only has HK listing, this board would have much fewer toxic / troll posts.",0
"guys, you know DIDI delist was expected right? they literally did not listen to Chinese regulator for the IPO. Of course they have to delist. Either way entire chinese shit lit will get hit tomorrow but calling 100 is dumb",1
"DIDI no comply with audit rules from beginning. DIDI is no BABA, buy the dip faggot.",0
didi is not fuckin baba,0
"I knew that we had too many bulls when we were at $170 and everyone and their dog was long as advised by their favourite YouTuber. NOW this board starts to look like we are at maximum fear level, which means buy level is close. 😉",0
I am tired to see long comments. Open your eyes! The stock price is telling you what's going on. Enjoy the ride.,1
"why all bears are celebrating, it's the same price as what it closed today. Any idea????",0
how’s China looking I see 118.,1
there are hundreds of other Chyna stocks that would delist before this one.,0
this is insane… fuck market manipulators and inside trading- hard to make sense of this stock price anymore,0
us investment banks laughing to the bank 🤡🤡🤡🤡 they got paid ! Goldman and Morgan! 😂😂😂😂😂 who’s the real suckers here hahahah sec is a gd joke! Lol f Gary gensler! I hope that rat sees this!,0
China wants to put ‘Alibaba’ on the censor list.  Step 1 is make stock worth crap.  Step 2 is delist.  Step 3 is take it home.  Step 4 is shut it down.  Think on that.  US regulations just helps a little.,1
🔥🔥🔥 I went ALL in on Alibaba...literally. + $13 Million.... 🤯 🤯,0
don’t feel bad for you guys. A million American stocks to buy and you bought Chinese,1
I think all of the possible bad news are out. This stock is heavily manipulated. I bought Tesla when it was $200 before split and it was exactly like this. Buying more tomorrow..,0
I HAVE LOST MY ABILITY TO SLEEP. I JUST WATCH THE BABA SHAREPRICE EVERY WAKING MOMENT. I BET ALL MY GRANDMAS RETIREMENT MONEY ON THIS STOCK. WHT DO I DO??? SHES GONNA KILL ME PLEASE HELP PROTECT ME. THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED AF THIS MAKES NO SENSE WHY IS THIS SHIT SO RIGGED DUDE,1
do the idiot bears on here know how highly owned Baba is by institutional investors?  Not getting delisted without blowing up entire market.,0
They gotta drive this down to about 20 bucks before they can afford to delist from NYSE,1
how do we buy if it gets delisted? Think it’s a good company but this is a falling knife right now,0
I just want to see under 100 and I will close all my positions and wait to put it all on SpaceX ipo.,1
Everyone is a delisting expert now.,0
90 coming lol 😂,0
The best part is baba down 5 percent because baba might have to trade in only HK. LoL even they don’t want it to trade there.,1
not being delisted. That would signal the end of foreign investment in China.,0
why would you hold or fight the sentiment of you can ride the flow? I had this at $268..toke a 10% loss and started buying puts. Do I really have to tell you who’s banking? Just take the criticism I’m not being a dink here,1
this stock will go up $1 for every like this gets!,0
"The CSRC, China’s SEC, said succinctly in response that “the news is not true.” Such is the state of markets that a completely false article still moves markets.  Proof the media is pushing false fear onto the market right here. Directly from China's SEC right here.  China planning a VIE ban rumors are false according the Chinese government!!!!",0
The short term worries settles sooner than later. Once that happens. BABA will be over $1000.,0
CNBC is most likely going to beat all Chinese stocks the Fuck down be prepared tommorrow. It’s unbelievable. Down 63 percent from highs but  overvalued us tech is the buy lol!,0

Okay so delisting could actually be good. How can we transfer shares to Hong Kong exchange? I own on Robinhood and Webull,0
all the reason bears have is “delisting”. Lol. Everyone is sucking Xi’s tits to get in China Market shares. Tesla included and you bears really think US is gonna delist big dog like BABA?? You guys are delusional.,0
I’m back buying  after selling at 182 during the last bounce and making profit. Let’s do that again. Only a small position for now though. Likely only regret will be not buying more but got to manage risk and it is a bit painful to own this stock to be honest.,0

I would not worry if I was an inventor just buy up more if it reaches around 100. This will pass and in 2-3 years  will be over 500,0
So that means US stocks will be also delisted from China? If Chinese government thinks about regulations?,1
this fool lost 300k on baba don’t be him,1
This guy is without a doubt- 2021 idiot of the year! I could go back further- show more ugly- but he posts 200 times a day & it would take forever. We all mess up- all of us.. but this guys posts are bizarre… what’s his story?? Makes no sense… just go opposite of his madness. He’s cooked! Good luck… run from these soon to be delisted stocks… China will never let their babies see a real audit..   And why won’t they??? We know why!!,1
if you were holding from 200+ you wouldn’t sell either.,0
it’s not fucking delisting idiots.,0
same as with bitcoins when it was at 4k. You don't see a lifetime opportunity even if it slaps you in the face. Nobody on the main street wanted it then. Laughing it's going to zero and mocking people saying it will go back to ATH (19k) now it was 60k and people yelling buy buy buy to 100k. Same with BABA. Buy now with all the FUD and enjoy $400+ in 1.5 year.,0
lesson learned. Never buy Chinese stock again even if they are at steal. The risk outweigh the reward.,1
breaking $120 feels like the equivalent to the white walkers shattering the ice wall in Game of Thrones lol,0
@tibiverson44  looks like a good time to start a position. i don’t think they will get delisted. too big fir that.  what you think?,0
it might go to $83 on delisting news,1
Down 25% last 25 days.,1

"still bullish, but I’ll share my one rule for buying the dip. Which is: stocks that are severely punished but still have a bullish outlook, which then recover and rally, almost never sell more than 70% from the peak. So my line in the sand is $92-93. Any more than that and I’m out.",0
"So far this company lost a market cap of almost $400 billions in last year, because of it were there any layoffs or any closures, what kind of impact happened as it lost such a HUGE market cap? The biggest thing is stock holders definitely lost huge. Thanks in advance",0
"has really become a 50/50 “gamble” at this point. Let me explain: if we were basing this solely on fundamentals, baba would be a near certain investment. However, we have to now account for political uncertainty, which in turn, equates to risk (uncertainty = risk). No one, except maybe an expert on Chinese politics AND US-China relations, can accurately asses the political risk now associated with baba. So, the fundamental analysis is what real investors do, and the investment analysis there is strong. But the political analysis inserts a degree of “gambling” (which is typically reserved for day traders and technical analysts). The future of baba hinges on politically uncertain questions. So at this point, I’d say baba is a 50/50 investment/gamble. I’m willing to take the gamble bc I like the fundamentals and I think the risk reward ratio bends in my favor (long term).",0

"""But investors shouldn't expect a stampede of companies to follow in Didi's footsteps, Citi's Alicia Yap wrote Friday.

"Free cash flow is approximately 30 billion USD annually. Cash and cash equivalents minus debt is approximately 90 billion USD in the positive. The market cap in USD is 350 billion USD.

"So, let's have a look on some  unbiased analysis!  The following article will take you to understand the delisting mechanism of U.S. stocks.     The capital market is changing rapidly, and entry and exit are the norm in the market. The delisting system is one of the basic systems for the healthy development of the capital market. In mature capital markets, the delisting of listed companies has become a normal phenomenon.     WFE data shows that from 2007 to October 2018, the total number of global delisted companies reached 21,280, and the total number of global IPOs reached 16,299. The scale of delisting was larger than the scale of IPOs.",0

If this gets delisted on US exchanges expect a flash flush! Flight of capital even though that obviously has been happening in preparation. Below 50 when China 🇨🇳 announces more decoupling measures. Quicksand,1
"I will not sell my position for sure! It will come back, target is $300!   If it gets delisted that would at Alibaba and China will!   If so, we can still buy it at OTC market!!! And that would be great to buy BABA even cheaper!   Luckin coffee went up 130% after being delisted!   People tend to trade in stupid ways, not invest and use their head long term!   Im buying more and more!",0

Up 3.4% on pre market. BABA is oversold. Companies like BABA which is UNDERVALUED will bounce back with ease no matter how bad the fall is recently. Don't need to try to predict the bottom as it's already a value buy now. The narrative will change soon and make sure you don't regret.,0
"if i was jack Ma, id be looking at spending some of the $77Billion in cash the company has on buying back some shares. Maybe $7B worth at $112 a share. 62,500,000 share buy back would be a strong show of strength. Afterall we are looking at prices from 5 years ago and a PS ratio of 2.6!!",0
lot of fortune tellers in here...  If you're here for a few years it doesn't matter what happens to the price in the next 6 months. Who cares about the fud and the teenager on his mums computer spouting price targets for Jan 1st. Buy the retail fear,0

"Beijing is preparing to host the 2022 Winter Games  American politicians should stop calling for a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics to avoid hurting bilateral ties and China will take ""countermeasures"" if necessary, China's foreign ministry said on Monday.  The Biden administration is expected to announce this week that US government officials will not attend the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, CNN reported on Sunday.  Those calling for a boycott are ""grandstanding"" and should stop ""so as not to affect the dialogue and cooperation between China and the United States in important areas,"" said Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesman.

I know this st is full of clowns and surely Chinese stocks got/get a beating. However I'm long long long. Maybe for all the bears its a smart thing to travel to China and see how bad that country does. It's pretty clear to the educated where the growth and power will be. We know the US will keep declining as they have been over the last decades. Just ask yourself what does the US produce, where does the majority of ""stuff"" come from. Who do they owe money to. Have we invested in our future (infrastructure,  education, technology, health care, poverty), and politically the country (usa) is destroyed from the inside.  The USa has been on a decline and will keep declining in the future. It's just a simple  change of power as happened with other powers in the history of the world",0

this is called baba the Chinese shit .we trade in u.s stock and buy u.s stock not Chinese scam,1

risk isn’t in the company Alibaba which is a titan.  The risk is in the fact you don’t actually own any Alibaba when you buy these shares.  Fact is you own a holding company in the Caribbean with unenforceable revenue sharing agreements with Alibaba,1

"The MFers who have been driving this down all year, don't care a whit about the fundamentals or the true value of this company. Nor do they care about any of the FUD they have helped to spread. All they see in this is *China.* And what they see in China is a country with 5 times the population of the US, with an economy that will likely overtake the US economy sooner than anyone anticipated. Instead of doing everything possible to be competitive, they are trying to make it seem as though Chinese stocks are uninvestable. They can't actually hurt Alibaba the business, but they can make future Chinese IPOs unattractive for US investors.",0

"As we all know Alibaba valuation, just with its ecommerce and Cloud business justifies a share price of at least USD300 once this year of anti trust and politics fades. So imagine if Alibaba can produce a chip that even Nvidia hasn't yet developed. Don't underestimate what's occuring behind the scenes at Alibaba. They will not have been distracted by the huge drop in share price... It will have only spurred them on to innovate and deliver something new to the world. Expect some big news in 2022 on this subject matter. China's badly misbehaved child may well become the golden child if they can deliver on this new technology.  Nvidia currently trades at a mkt cap of USD800B. Food for thought.",0

"@Britlion I agree completely, this is never a sprint.   My main takeaway - props to  for working so well on taking proactive measures & working actively on the publicity side.

"was the biggest IPO in US history. It is one of the biggest, most profitable companies in China. The growth of this company since the 2014 IPO has been astonishing. And the valuation has never matched it's true value, even when it was over $300 per share. This year long attack will change none of that. We will eventually return to ATHs and more.",0
"Nothing changed—Except Lehman events u folding…actually few more things got worse, e.g olympics, china lost face, evergrande “restructuring”, baba in turmoil hiring random guys and reshuffling whole company “giving subdepartments more autonomy”—simply translates into lack of leadership,  bad time to pump…carefull Kiddos, do not get burned here…money was made past three days…No let them take it to low 90’s next for next possible desperate pump…",1
it could be dropping to 117- 118 area then recovery. Hold strong baby,0

Anyone know how to read financial statement? company is really undervalued compared to everything else.. guys know when to buy.. when fear drives people this is when you buy... This isn't some new start up company.. This is literally one of the gaints in China the RUNS THINGS and currently P.E ratio is at 17? This is why you lose no calculation. I just can't believe how undervalued this company is right now wtf is going on... The only reason I am not dumping my shares is because I have a plan..

we need to break through $130,0
why does baba gotta be the slowest China stock to rebound 😂🤦‍♂️,0
May I share a piece of advice? Stop letting the bears write your headlines. It’s a phenomenal company with a great future. Your choice to be in BABA (anything Sub $180) is a great move. Even high averages will do well as this stock will hit $300 before you know it.,0
"Looks like CCP is again manipulating foreign investors into believing there is no imminent DELISTING awaiting. I wouldn’t risk my money on INSECURE stocks, especially COMMUNIST CHINESE stocks. Be cautious.",1

See these bears? Screenshot and keep them safe. Look at them in 8-12 months and see how ridiculous they were. This is an Exercise  you can do so that you can learn to tune out the noise. I recommend screenshotting 10-12 bear comments. It’ll be good for you to see how bad they age. See you at $450,0

Alibaba had a plan to gain 200 million overseas users now cemented and their next goal is 1 billion overseas customers. Their competitors have nothing close to the total domestic and international number of customers Alibaba has. You would have to add them all up to even get close to Alibaba's customer base right now. Alibaba's goal now is to reach 2 billion people in coming years. Now that the China market is secured. The battle for South east Asia and Global domination has begun. This shift in focus will fuel massive growth over the next few years. This marks the beginning of a campaign only Alibaba is equipped to take on and ensures solid growth for a decade. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,0
"Alibaba is taking CCP sensitive information seriously and decoupling the potentially sensitive information from its international business, Chinese media was concerned that Alibaba would have to take over the ""Tsinghua Unigroup"" which would have not faired well for Alibaba as it was to be forced on them to handle but a state ran firm has been called to handle their restructuring which is bullish for Alibaba.

15 billion usd share buyback + 68 billion cash + 33% of Ant. Stock is way oversold! Should be at least 300 usd,0
@mei1 literally the most desperate statement heard from a  bear. I mean dude. The worst case this has downside of another 20 dollars. The best case an upside of 400. No brainer honestly at this point,0

My last visit to China was January 2020.  Shanghai looks pretty damn capitalist to me.,0
@not_financial_advice   If you made sense I wouldn’t haft you come on this thread to correct you. Your trying to bash baba because you have puts that are otm. Why are you asking if this can get to $500 with otc ? If any stock and get to $500 OTC it would be,0
"This is why wealth isn't for everyone. It's alright if bears are, for the lack of a better word, stupid enough not to see the potential BABA has. When the reward is riped for us to take, maybe we can share our wealth by hiring them bears to clean our houses. Shring is caring aye.",0

Those of you who have no idea.. This stocks is getting destroyed because the Chinese government is trying to put regulation and restriction on huge companies in China and thus scared even alot of hedge funds and whales to dump out of this stock and really undervalued. Let me tell you something about fear. Its always good to do your own research. Right now is the time to buy this stock. People are always clueless. Now watch some hedge funds pick Alibaba up and it will shoot back to 200 and you guys will THEN Start investing.. I just dont get it.. Why dont you just value the company yourself so you know.. Literally broke my own day trading rule and holding 10% of my prof in this stock. People have no idea. Its freaking sad. Once this goes up like 80% THEN news will go like alibaba is still growing and then you guys put your money.. I just dont get the mindset.. btw average price is 122 for me,0
buying the 12/17 140’s at the open playing the investor day surge,0
Trying to figure out in what form Alibaba’s 944th cut will take.  More fines?  Or maybe one of their top two influencers will leave?  Or something nasty to poison investor day?,1
let’s go baba $130 tomorrow morning,0
up 4% on HK market,0
It's a no brainer buy at this level. Even the media knows using delisting as an ammo doesn't work anymore and hence we don't see it in the headlines. The price always catches up to the intrinsic value. Bull run is definitely coming. LFG.,0
not sure the short / mid term but I see more upsides than downsides. The combination of misfortunate events this year has been staggering .. I’d be surprise to see those extended for other 12 months ..,0

Let me get this straight.  If they delist your stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity which is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba’s  Chinese assets but you will don't actually own them. And convert them to Hong-Kong's shares of your stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity . And then I would have to pay foreign tax on that. Good luck with this..,1

this stock is a shorts dream. I don't see a bottom $80 isn't safe. It not trading on realistic facts. Pure fear its been in a free fall for over a year.  They don't have any money left for the prosperity plan? $baba is in the no return on equity jail. Life sentence,1

850 shares at 141.60. Does not feel great right now. But the fundamentals are too strong to sell at a loss. This should be a 300 dollar stock. Hold strong.,0

"breaking down its earnings in more transparent manner, developing a state of the art chip, going carbon neutral by 2030, having international separation from domestic, management shake up, etc. The stock has barely moved with all this.

If you look at recent news that’s been push beneath all of the fud—major institutions are starting to turn bullish on China despite any uncertainty.   I also see a lot of people laugh at Chinese stocks because of their underperformance this year, but a lot of American stocks are trading  -50% from their 52 week high as well meanwhile the S&P 500 is still near its 52 week high🤷🏽‍♂️. I think from an economic prospective China has done a lot deflating bubbles, regulating their companies and crypto—which again America remains far behind. People still consider China an emerging market but honestly in 2022-2023 I believe China will be the market. Big Money knows America will produce low returns and China will be the 1st place they look for to gain returns…just my opinion. Laugh now bears—cry later…  pt: 250",0

"this stock has priced in much more negative news than there actually are.  the reason for which price is so compressed is because it is way too obvious that FUNDAMENTALLY the company is a very good buy.  my guess is that as long as dumbo retails continue to buy in relentlessly, the price will be kept compressed for a long long while.",1

I think all tax loss harvesting is done. The following are this weekend’s media coverages that impact Chinese stock’s movement tomorrow. All are bullish. Hope more bullish news will come out by tomorrow morning. 1. China’s new VIE rule eases concerns about overseas IPOs … 2. China Cinda takes 24% of Ant’s consumer credit unit  3. The world’s most indebted property developer reports progress completing homes 4. China replaces Xinjang CP chief who oversaw prosecution of Uyghurs,0

"double bottom forming, I think this rally back by close",0
all those dumbo retails purchasing naked short term calls are fucked.  the relentless buying from dumbo retails certainly has the price were it currently is.  tax harvesting and manipulation also major variables that weigh much.  VERY VERY bearish!,1

the general population in Asia just now receiving the vaccine and starting to open up slowly. I think in the next 6 months Asia will rebound quite nicely.

Why would HK invest in Chinese companies? China is basically their hostage taker. They were a democracy till China came in and took over.,1
"IMHO I apply a simple concept.  Analyze the stock and if it’s within your investment strategy and can assume the risk then just buy and hold.  No time for posting smack about price targets nor bashing anyone regardless if they are long or short the stock.  I actually want all retail investors to make money.  GLTA, personally im holding strong and time will tell the outcome.",0
Global investment dollars are leaving China by the truckload they are going to be delisted in the US. They think coming out and saying yes we want to scam idiots in the US still is bullish. The only ones who think it is bullish are the idiots being scammed.,1

To deal with the reality would be too painful to bear, so we print money galore and the boomers continue living lavish while future generations will get the squeeze.

This will go down in history books. F*cking Alibaba Group is trading below 120$ / share price 😂,0
You all need to understand this. This is going down due to the same reasons S&P has floated up on certain days.   It’s low volume movement from baby traders/investors. You are basically selling at cheap prices to sharks that are accumulating here. Look at dark Pool orders yesterday and $5M+ call buys above ask.,0

headed back to 113 today or maybe tomorrow! The drop has gone low enough! Let’s go! Calling all bulls! time to bring this baby back to 118+ eow!,0
if this closes green or close to it I’ll run around naked. this stock is discounted huge at this price! we go back to 120 from here!,0
"Alibaba is buying back shares here, should jump 10% this week with more buy back announcement",0
with great pessimism comes great opportunities - Spider-Man from metaverse 🤔,0
Just defend $111 and we will cool down.😎,0
"The the cost average of all outstanding shares is $155.62, with owned shares costing anywhere from the 200s down to the lows. So there are a lot of bagholders. It will certainly rise again, but damn....this has been rough.",0
Buy tax loss selling done today.,0
Just 10 months ago this was at 267. Lost 58% in 10 months.,1
FAIL MORE   GO LOWER  HATE THIS STOCK SOOOO MUCH      BELOW $100 and stay there for many years,1
250 target by march 2022,0
@GoodNewsBull  I'm holding for 180-200+ We might never see theses prices again.,0
"Sold my puts already at $110 ""double"" bottom.  those puts were just a hedge against my position.",0
a close above yesterdays close would be a good sign for short term bullish action.  a close above yesterdays high would be even better!,1
delist $0 imminent,1
85 by February,1
guess no one has ever bought products from Alibaba cause I have and they suck. Takes months to get the item and it's a cheap knock off that you could have went to Ross and got as off the shelf item that doesn't fall apart. I bought clothes and stitching started coming apart after the first time washed. But its products made cheap by slaves.,1
down 3.5% on a red day is pretty good tbh. usually its 5-7%,0
"this piece of shit is so insanely undervalued, that even shorts are avoiding it.  Good buy signal.",0
National Party Congress October 2022. Run up starts Monday....$300,0
let’s go bulls! The shorts want us to lose our money! We have to buy more than they are selling here! We can still overcome this selling pressure! this price is extremely low! Won’t find a better deal with this stock Chinese or not!,0
Today is the last day to harvest a tax loss on this in 2021. I wonder if that will lower selling pressure starting tomorrow?,0
This is setup clearly for a violent comeback post tax loss harvesting season. There is no downside from here except for maybe next 2 days. US stocks are clearly overvalued so value hunters will look to rotate and the best value currently is in emerging markets.,0
can America combine and unite to pull off the biggest rally in history?! teamed up with Americans! we take it over 113 today!,0
"second worst position this year. For a company that basically has a monopoly on global supply chains, ~15 PE is insanely cheap",0
only down 2.5%? thats extremely bullish,0
today is last day to cover for shorts to post for this year. Looks like will spike in the second half. Next 2 days may be low though. Hopefully not,0
China and America together combine to rally the China stocks in American Market! Blessed!!! China and America to combine to rescue CHINESE STOCKS IN AMERICA!,0

45 June $180'call at 1.60.... can we do it :),0
Added on the opening drop today. Big funds are manipulating price to play options and I've seen this pattern many times. All dips seem to get bought up immediately so the buy interest remains pretty strong.,0
"2 more bloody days maybe, fuck this shit, it was pain the whole year and f*ed many portfolios, let's hope for a bright 2022",0
China one of only countries cutting rates. Expecting stimulus will follow. Regulation overhang weighing heavy on all these Chinese big tech names. Any inkling of good news on them loosening their grasp could cause a nice spike. Hang in there: it will eventually turn. It always does.,0
Last time Alibaba Closed below 113 the stock moved to 123. Let’s see tomorrow.,0
opens at 109,1
need these to guy 50% up!!! $coin 55% jan $$ $btc.x 120k,0

"at $110, current operations is valued at $150B with $30B in FCF and growing at 30% a year. Baba could buyback all its stock and go private in less than 5 years. It’s just math.",0
perfect close over 112 from Dec 3rd capitulation. 112-130 is still the range for now.,0
crazy to think one of the greatest value investors of all time Charlie Munger was buying this at $220…I think this will go under $100…that’s when I’ll start adding,1
when 110 goes it will crash to 99,1
Delisting by June? Or later?,1
January effect should get this pop 20-30%,0

come the F on hang seng !!! Let’s do this!!!! GET BACK TO 120 USD,0
Interesting events behind the curtains with Alibaba and Chinese govt... the government is okay with Alibaba's monopoly & rising power as long as they own a controlling stake and as long as BABA rids/suppresses itself of any political power and social power which is why it has voluntarily liquidated its stakes in several multibillion dollar media empires in the past several months and in addition to its controlling 30% stake in social media weibo.  A lot of the divestment activities have occurred towards the end of the year which has all been last minute. This accelerated last-minute executed agenda means something big is coming soon.,0
115+ so far .. lets hope 123 by tomorrow,0
"@cylouisa just wait until   needs to divest its investment like it did with Weibo and Tencent with JD shares.    Xi is in control now and will govern these company the way he wants, not the company themselves",1

"On December 30, Hong Kong stocks plunged in the afternoon, and technology stocks weakened. Among them, Alibaba fell more than 1% to HK $109.2, setting a new low for listing.   Besides, Alibaba's Xianghubao announced on December 28 that the mutual aid program will cease operation on January 28, 2022.   Will this consequent price flactuation in 's US market tomorrow? How do you think?",1
"The Global Times, a CCP friendly, Chinese nationalistic tabloid, has a new story with the following headline: ""Alibaba likely to emerge from ""dark woods"" in 2022, albeit facing tougher competition.""",0

"The day this pumps people won't have time to buy. It fell sharply but when it turns it will be as aggressively as it fell. We don't know when that's gonna happen but it will - this is not a rubbish company, just look at the fundamentals. It can't just fall forever. Just make sure you are not too heave in and DCA keeping a good portfolio risk management. And know where to get out because event if it's a great stock you may need to get out if it makes new lows and you are heavily invested. Good luck everyone!",0

BEARS GETTING DESTROYED TODAY!   POWER HOUR WE COULD SEE $130,0
Glad to see you guys' are getting an end of the year rally. Nobody wants to see the stock they own end the year on a negative note. Luckily it did not fall below the $110 mark. If it can now head for and break the $130 trading level things will start to look better. There is a range between $110-$150. Let the pendulum move higher.,0
I told you baba 150 next Friday 🤝,0

"$72b in cash 😂   With more than $72 billion in the bank, Alibaba isn't exactly hurting for cash. It even generated more than $24 billion of new free cash flow over the past year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence).

HULU TV is the Future Disney $220 🚀,0
Snowballs chance in hell of running above $150 this week. Current CEO is a moron and Spiderman has been priced in all year. Noone is moving to Hulu because it's trash.,1
I see a 152.00+ opening tomorrow.,0
"Only $4M away from 2nd , let's wait and see tomorrow for the adjusted numbers if it can beat it or not 🚀",0
looks like youtube tv panicked and just announced they renegotiated to get ESPN etc back so they wouldn’t lose their customers to Hulu again ( owned 67% by DIS) like they did earlier this year for a bit. Done deal. Glad I don’t have to switch back. Bearish on that news short term.,1
"Good news for DIS that they get some profits and shine from Spiderman and Google capitulation. But, not sure it will overcome the overall market taking a shiz tomorrow. You've got the media scaring the crap out of the regular folks about omicron. Front page news. Uncertainty back about major business disruptions. Lockdowns in Europe. My line of work earns income treating covid patients in the hospital, but we all would truly be rather seeing run of the mill conditions. So tired of all it like the rest of you. I truly believe they would only shut down parks if they noticed new mortality rate at some ridiculous number. Permabull for the company. Neutral on Chapek. Until covid is at the bottom of the google news feed, the section most people ignored before covid, the rise past $200 may take a little longer.",0

30% upside from here on share price! $191 Price Target -I'll take that!,0
"Disney reiterated overweight at BofA, sees nearly 30% upside on recovery in theme parks, content slate  Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich reiterated her overweight rating and $191 price target, implying almost 30% upside in shares, as the company is likely to benefit from strong additions to Disney+ this quarter, such as ""The Beatles: Get Back,"" ""Hawkeye"" and ""Boba Fett,"" and a recovery in its parks business. For the first quarter, Reif Ehrlich expects Disney (DIS) to add roughly 7 million subscribers to Disney+, which would be more than 5 million than it added last quarter.",0
Called shot: this will close green.  Keeps bouncing on these down days….wonder what happens when we get good omnicron news,0
$191.00 Price Target - 30% profit from here!,0
"May see some dips upon lockdown measures, ex.  movie theatres not permitting the sale of snacks. However DIS knows how to get their stock up and down when they need it, if it dips to 146 I will buy another share. If if drops to 135, Ill buy one more. When DIS goes back to the 170's they were in (and should be in rn) it will be pure profits.",0
in channel and is one of the only tickers I’m watching as of now. Still see lots of value. Sitting at area of high confluence just below bottom of trend line and $145.80 support.  Great risk to reward play… .Risk .30 cents for $4 to top of channel IF the market can bounce.  This morning we rejected top of supply at 147.50 so we need this to reclaim supply for anything bullish really.  Going to start light with some $150 calls with my stop a close below premarket low 145.30,0
it’s at pre covid high before dividend was cut and before Disney plus took off. IMO Probably a bit more resistant to large market moves at this price.,0
Atleast $500 to $1Billion in Merch profits,0
BoFA Reiterates Buy PT $191  We estimate 7mn DIS net adds in FY1Q driven by new titles such as The Beatles; Get Back and Hawkeye.  We anticipate FY1Q will reflect signs of improvement in attendance at Theme Parks.   We believe DIS has become a “show me” story as investors await signs of DIS+ net adds to re-accelerate and theme parks to show operating leverage as attendance improves.,0

"Who cares if the parks reach full capacity. We probably need to stop hanging the stock price on that hat. Disney 𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 decided they had enough loyalty (had it years ago) that they could cut down the passholder freeloaders and start actually managing capacity. Plus they caught up to the industry standard of offering to pay extra for quick access to premium rides. No one knows if they will get it absolutely right, but if anyone has the brains and loyalty to pull it off, it's Disney. Pure profit, happier paying customers due to less crowds.",0

rose about 8.65% at $55.4 in pre-market trading Tuesday. The company today announced its intention to take Mobileye public in the United States in mid-2022 via an initial public offering (IPO) of newly issued Mobileye stock.,0

just sell and buy amd guys lmao.. its over in a few years!,0
"The company recently shipped its 100 millionth EyeQ chip system and unveiled a six-passenger vehicle that will be used for driverless ride-hailing services in Tel Aviv and Munich next year. It has won contracts with more than 30 top automakers globally. Mobileye has about 80% of the global market for advanced driver-assistance vision systems, according to researcher Guidehouse Insights",0

only green semi stock. 66 today,0
why exactly would the share price jump on news that they’re spinning something off?,0
"I think too many folks are missing the forest for the trees.  Another pundit talking and he said Intel not growing, would be down 5% again this year.  That is NOT true. Intel will be flat to up this year,  you have to take out $4.5B of the memory business they are selling.  Last year Intel grew 8 - 9% on earnings and revenue.  Pat just reaffirmed in the last week that Intel will grow 10 - 12% CAGR over the next 4 - 5 years.  Cisco gave guidance of 5 - 6.5% growth and they have a P/E of over 20X.  Think about this,  Pat reaffirms 10 - 12% CAGR and a few days later announced they will IPO Mobileye next year which is growing 50%.  So Pat still thinks he can grow 10-12% even without one of his growth engines.  People are not paying attention.",0
take your gap up and run will easily go back to 40s for 5 yrs,1
When good news is never enough...EVER,0
I have a 75% position. I’ll buy the remaining 25 on any weakness.,0
I wish it would just touch $51.20 already. we all know it's going to happen.,0
"didn't expected this will go down this low, very good entry level.",0
i bought in the 40s and sold it on that pop to 53.   I whole heartedly do not like the CEO Patty. He sounds like a car salesman trying to hard. Not humble and way to positive when they are still so far behind. FUCKING INTEL IS BACK...WHAT A JOKE.   Ill rebuy back in the 40's where it belongs for a long time.,1
"Take a moment and go 3 years back on Microsoft.  Intel is Microsoft.2   Out with the old CEO, new blood in to shake off the old bad management, value will be released.   I sleep easy owning this stock.",0

Intel looks to be the first recipient of ASML's High NA machine. The first High NA machine will be available for early access from 2023. Customers will then be able to use them for their research and development in 2024 and 2025. They're likely to be used in high-volume manufacturing from 2025 onward. A semiconductor analyst said ASML's new machine would allow chip manufacturers to make chips below three nanometers.,0

Do to the demand of semiconductors and the explosion of what we will very likely see in future demand of semiconductors, do we not think Intel is going to grow Exponentially over the next 5-10 years?   Increased capacity alone is going to grow Intel. It’s not like Intel isn’t selling every “inferior” chip they produce today. (80 billion in revenue). Add to this process leadership execution by a team of leaders that understand both hardware and software (got rid of bean counter leadership), Intel is a triple from here within 5 years.   I think the market is going to be thinking about safer investments in the next 2-3 years as well. What a great and safe place to park a big hunk of cash over this time frame!",0

"prettiest weekly chart in the mkt. Saw an interview on Bloomberg w Nadella a few weeks back. They have their hands in everything. The big money will jump all over this at the 50 weekly, which coincides w previous breakout level. You can see in the past when things get real shi#y it will actually go below the center line in the weekly bband temporarily. Cant take the risk to wait on that level. just auto buy weekly. Your broker should offer fractional shares if you cant buy whole ones. A must in everyone's portfolio When the mkt goes back these mega caps at least help buffer the losses by only backing up 10%+/- while the more speculative stocks can give back as much as 50% and potentially never recover.

FTC Challenges Nvidia's $40 Billion Deal For Arm Holdings -- Update,1
Bears!! Public Service Announcement!! The world is ending!! Short NVDA to glory!! I need some more Shares!! 😜,0
"- I’ll sell my retirement shares when you pry them from my cold dead fingers.   Bears think this news is surprising  and that the bulls will panic and sell. Nvidia is moving into a multi segment earnings machine. Software, hardware, AI, etc.  No other company has the moat that Nvidia will have in 10 years.",0
"FTC basically said NVIDIAs too powerful, this acquisition was the last infinity stone. AMD and Intel are shaking in their boots",0
America - Capitalism is the only way!!  FTC - “No not like that!!”,0
I got my put just in time before market closed at 4pm. Y'all better run away from this stock. Institutional selling more after the lawsuit. RUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN!!!! DO your y'all MOMAS THIS FAVOR OR I'M COOKING.,1
this arm purchase was unnecessarily hanging over the company.  this goes up because they now dont have to make any concessions like they would have for buying arm.  NOTHING BUT CLEAR BLUE SKIES AND 40+ BILLION SAVED.,0
bought some earlier at $315... sitting around AH waiting for it to tank to grab more but NOPE... it goes UP instead. Like the guy said below.. they should be sued more often.,0
LOL looks like Bears heard my Call and Shorted on Margin!! 🤣,0
forget about the ARM deal. Use the $40 bil to award the investors via dividends or buybacks. :),0
are we worried if the ARM deal gets blocked?  I am long either way just haven’t had a chance to read up on this.  Thx.,0
ready for dump?  witht nvda news media will say blah blah futures red,1
"bought a few puts on the way out today. Loading up more tomorrow morning.   When it’s official it’ll fall hard, or not.  A risk I’ll take.",1
JP Morgan says buy the Omicron variant dip.,0
"this is going sub 300 tomorrow , its f'd up bear market....going green is impossible tomorrow",1
funny thing about people who have no clue. I’m up 41k after buying in June of 21,0
5 Omicron cases in NYC toasted the AH. It was just a matter of time. Geez. Another overreaction.,0
watch this hit 330 tomorrow regardless. So many fake bulls here hoping for quick money. This is not a meme stock fools. Its long. Easy money long. Not for the short sighted.,0
why the futures are selling off ? it looks like a rough day tomorrow,0
"Here's what's so hysterical about these moronic 'the sky is falling' bear posts...the ARM FTC news broke at 3pm. The market didn't give a shit. The stock continued to rise, and did even more so in after hours, actually popping $3. The price only dropped when the NYC Omicron news broke around 6pm-ish, just another short lived kneejerk reaction. Hope you shorted with your kids college money, bears, the short squeeze will be epic.",0
"Arm obviously would have been beneficial to Nvda in expanding certain aspects of its business.  But, not closing that deal means nothing to their existing robust business.  Absolutely Nothing.  They made that clear a thousand times.  All you need to do is ask yourself how not having Arm will affect any of NVDAs markets.  The answer is it won’t and that is undisputed.  Arm gives Nvda opportunities and is found money.  But those opportunities have zero impact upon existing business.  Therefore Arm is a non issue.",0
I see dead people stuck in margin. See you at 350 by eom,0
this will break 308 tomorrow,1
sell your shares to me. I really mean it.,0
"Over the last 30 days, nine analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates.",0
"Investors in NVIDIA Corporation NVDA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 17, 2021 $137.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.",0
Bought another 10 shares,0
"ARM need Jensen as a leader with great vision. Not the other way around. Nvidia kept innovating and made faster and faster products. Imagine how powerful ARM will be when Jensen takes the wheel.   Hopefully in the end Nvidia gets ARM but if it gets blocked, ARM will go public anyway cuz SoftBank wants to unload ARM and Nvidia will buy a huge share So either way All roads lead to Rome  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  ☕️💎",0
"because the price of nvidia’s stock has sky-rocketed since the announcement of the arm deal, its more like an $80 billion deal.  thats insane.  this was a godsend for this to be halted.  nvidia should increase their r&d with the money they are saving and come up with a cpu thats the envy of all tech companies.",0
"Bad news is good news, good news is bad news.",0
Bears are so ignorant thinking this will go down long term,0
Yesterday this guy said this is going back to $250….where did he go? 🤔,0
Good jobs number and they fear higher rates. Eat a bowl. It’s manipulating. Got to deal with the wipsaw…. Swing trade if you can,0
the ARM deal puts more money back into NVDA. Let’s go to work Jensen.,0

hover at 309 wait for down push,1
"This is an amazing dip and Great Entry whoever was sitting on a sideline, you can't gonwrong with this at all. I been holding it all along and never Sold a single share. If you can hold on to volatility you will gain a massive return!",0
"wow I saw a lot of bulls earlier. Cmon guys, this is expected. Looking for good position for calls, not convinced yet",1
these idiots are telling you NVDA is going inder $300 - don't listen to em.,0
sold my puts waaaay too early smh,1

don’t guy into this crap. The stock will continue to sell all day long.,1
"if you have young kids, ask them about meta verse. They know the future better than $250k a year Analyst. Relax, if you can’t afford to be in red then you shouldn’t be dealing with the future tech.",0
i think shes coming down to 260 by end of month.,1
eill this go below 300?,1
Drop below $300 already,1
another name I love long term But so does everyone else.   That’s a steep drop if it breaks below 292…so I dare buy puts on the future of tech’s darling? 🤔,1
I would sell why u have the opportunity this isn’t looking too good for today calls on Monday,1
will continue to fall throughout the day then calls for next week,1
remember this company never had arm and it’s deal was expected to fail. It had a great run despite what bears say. This is a market correction due to inflation scare. I keep buying,0
added to my short position at 305.78. Stock can’t seem to hold 306. With a profit locked in I just added my final shares for the day to my short position at 303.60. A tight stop is in place but guessing we test $300  25/250/25months  Follow my bio,1
See this at $320+ next week no stress pre panic weekend sell off and will get bought up quick into next week. All targets are $350+ bears are dreaming of 200s,0
break below 302 on deck,1
Whats the matter Bears!! Cant seem to break 300!!,0
"Citadel won't be whipping their CNBC puppets this evening. Their FUD of ""Obey and Sell"" is working according to plan 🤦  Can't wait to see what Halloween tricks they come up with on Monday ☠️👻  Keep your heads up bulls, just like variant D this too will soon pass 🍻",0
you will just rebuy for Higher Price,0
$280 puts look juicy,1
right in the ass! Hope everyone with calls has a good fuckin weekend. I hope my liver shuts down.,0
"slid into correction territory today bears gotta eat too but, it’s also one of the few stocks that can rebound Monday for 330$",0
All they did was sell everybody high priced weekly options!! 🤪,0
In a few weeks we won’t even remember this. 400+ coming soon🔥🚀💰🚨,0
this is like Microsoft in the dotcom bubble.,1
long bias on Monday as long as it’s above 306,0
Hope you bought Friday’s dip for…  MONDAY’s RIP,0
370$ strike for 3/18 was that a dumb move?,0
Really praying for a rebound Monday but I just don’t see it happening,0
couldn’t close over 306  How telling,1

"Downtrend in process after omicron scare, Fed speedier tapering, and lawsuit regarding ARM acquisition. Until the uncertainty clears up buying puts to protect shares is prudent. Short term bearish",1
Has one bad day when insiders sell shares for taxes and everyone loses their minds …. Will bounce back Monday,0
"Long term company, adding at any price when I have extra cash",0
insiders selling shares is a bad sign,1
"@optown124 that was my thoughts on Friday, short some  puts and put a few longs on.",0
Bears are so sad and ignorant. Go short elsewhere. Don’t ever bet against brilliant CEO Jensen,0
bullish. Arm was always a long shot baked into price hence only 4-5% drop on a bad marker day,0
Don’t listen to the idiot below. It’s $309 USD currently.,0
"open at 313, flying high with the Hoff",0
it’s already priced in😰  Balance sheet so healthy now 😰  $10T company 😰  Bears are idiots 🤷‍♂️,1
"do i feel ok if 1,400 shares of NVDA stock get assigned to me? Sure!",0
Nvidia will save ~75B ( based on current stock price) if ARM deal breaks apart (which I feel already happened) and 1st thing nvda doesn’t need ARM for it’s organic growth.. so stop panicking and buy/hold,0
Overpriced piece of crap. Lets go $240.,1
So market is green and this is down 3-4% lol wtf rip my calls better come up to close that gap,0
buy again at $250,1
under 290 today 😬😬😬,1
"semiconductor will still be the future in years to come. You need it everywhere, phone computer, crypto mining, meta, everything goes to digital this day. I hope it dips to buy more though.",0
thinking about selling TSM and buying NVDA or TSLA. Which one would you choose?,0

I just added tons. Tens of thousands. Christmas came early with this lifetime hold. Will be over 400 next year. Easy call.,0
"$285 is ultra short term support, but I don't think it can hold there, more stronger support is $250.",1
shit i wish i had more cash. Such an opportunity ...hot damn. What a dip hope it keeps dipping even though im in the red,0
Go the other way once Cramer say something good on a certain stock..the guy has Fauci syndrome.,0
this may end up green by close......what a dumb  15 minute tech dump. Expecting 315 again by Wednesday...,0
"- If you didn’t sell at $333, hold it. Will pass that within 4 months if not sooner.",0
so much buying and selling its all cancelling itself out lol. Who will prevail??? Let give it a day to chill.,0
370 call 2024 my offer is up. A fare offer.,0
ignore the noise. Here we go now treasury yields that didn't seem to matter last month. Institutional pressure to shake weak hands hit margin accounts before reloading the christmas rally,0

Gonna test 50ma within these few days... maybe we will get to see 100ma with the CPI data and fomc lol..,1
I recall when Cisco and Lucent had similar valuations back in 1999,1
we need 294 to break,0
will fill the 268 gap. Not buying here...,1
if we can close above 287 on daily we should test 308+ this week,0
bought at 283 and gonna hodl. If it goes lower I will add. These are the type of companies you want to want to hold for the long term.,0
Happy to have  added to my portfolio! Waiting with more cash in case it keeps dropping to the 250/260's.,0
iron chef choppy out there -- I expect we'll continue to see little pops above previous resistance to get everyone that's not paying attention to the overall market/macros to chase a breakout and dump into them. With all the sell stops this is setting up we could see another drop in the next 2-3 days similar to the size of the gap down this AM (308 -> 281),1
got some at 282,0
back below 290 today watch and learn,1
I will stop buying and start selling if you could show me your crystal ball. How are you so sure you are smarter than others?,0

Unless the 4dma can recapture the 9 on the daily & hold this  will continue the downtrend trend.  This is the daily zoomed.,1
My buddy grabbed a 302.5 call  Doesn't seem too crazy of a gamble,0
who saw the 306 AH wtf? CNBC,0
huge bounce and reversal dragonfly doji off of 50% retracement from this monster run..,0
slow bleed down to $220. Then maybe it will reverse because The smart money doesnt buy at the top. They ran it to $346 then they short it back to $220 then will cover their shorts and buy more shares for the run back up.,1
Dropped 10 percent in 5 trading days. Total bullshit,0
Got some weekly 320 calls at around 286. I hope it could hit 6 dollars sometime in the coming days.,0
See ya later Bears!  325 by end of the week.  Lets go bulls!,0

310 just rejected again.,1
I think the Arm tantrum for 2021 is done and dusted. Perhaps a 5% correction when it will be officially announced in Q2 nwxt year. Lets see 450 before that news.,0

8% day easy,0
is the rockstar of stocks. I have owned shares since 2010. They are up almost 100x. Bears have been short. Their ratios indicate it is too expensive. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Investors always pay up for growth.,0
PT for today for Nvda any good solid reliable ideas?,0
"Price action is just like clockwork.  Never changes.  If people want to make money, Nvda will always give you a payday.  The only requirement is that you have loyalty and not chase it.",0
We are in a stealth correction. The 4dma can't even recapture the 20 now to say nothing of retaking the 9 which it needs to do to turn bullish. And now there is a gap up with an H&S forming.  Get ready for another hit.,1
Here ill help....up over 5.5% now lol,0
Last week was brutal on my portfolio,0

loaded 700 shares,0
y’all have a quick $0.08-$0.09 on a spread at 295/292.5 in the put chain right now…  Best end-of-week quick trade stock I’ve found…  Lots of places to grab some quick wins here on Friday afternoon.,0
needs a big volume push here up to 303 minimum,0
Shorting to 270 (Disclosure: I own core long shares),1
damn I felt so lucky to grab 299 earlier. Now I feel less special.,0
Stop losses under $300. The crooks MMs know what they’re doing. They want all the cheap  shares.,0

Down over 12K in last 3 weeks but I am holding my Shares!! This company will be higher soon.,0
bulls can you describe what pattern do you see here? FOMC next week says a visit to the 50 MA around 270-280.,1
Charts shows a wedge! Good luck next week should be a good 1 unless JP shits on our run! Very possible,0
"I might be wrong, because I’m not a professional analyst, but the idea that rising rates will affect companies like Nvidia and AMD, to the point their stock prices will stall out or drop, doesn’t ring true for me. It’s hard to believe that either company, or similar growing companies,  will not have enough cash flow to handle higher rates. Perhaps some great breakthrough in quantum computing will catch the two I mentioned off guard, but they’re already considering quantum, and if they need to buy quantum companies, they’ll likely do it. Plus, quantum is far from being a game changer, although it will be at some point. For the next five years Nvidia, AMD and the like have a long way to go and they’re just revving up.",0
bullish at 300 holding resistance well. Last week down 10% time to rebound. Likely will attempt in first 30 seconds then we will see how far it runs until the pull back per usual morning volume,0
Phenomenal company but a stock clearly in need of a correction.,0
buyer at 270,1
Swung 1/21/2022 350c @ 5.60. Taking profit @ a share price of 325/330. It will be there this week… potentially tomorrow.,0
VWAP is 304.5. Getting close to going under that.,1
7am will give us an idea of direction. We pass 307.50. And sky's the limit,0
trading under its 304.5 VWAP after going up in premarket.,1

"Long term I’m a Bull, but I’ll congratulate the bears for the last 9 trading sessions. You’ve had a good run, but I wouldn’t push it.",0

"this is the only stock with a realistic chance of hitting 1000. Sell if you think you can find better. But honestly….it will hit that 1000 mark within 2 years, and you will regret it.",0
What's a good entry? Think this could dip below 290s.,1
"so, what's the next support Guys? 290?",1
will 287 hold ?,1
nobody's buying til after Wednesday then there still may be a sell off. This is still up Bigly for the year so pullback isn't too damaging if you hold longer than a month.,1
BUY PUTS BELOW 293.70,1
330 eow 😂,1

Buying 6 290c exp 12/23 thanks 350,0
no brainer under $288,0
Going to $320 by tomorrow?  That's what it did last week.,0
It may stand above 300 by the end of the day. Then there will be a short squeeze like last Tuesday tomorrow.,0
295 squeeze point,0
Probably under 250 by Friday after Fed Decision! Buying more then.,0
will never see $300 again,1
"day 4 of ""the dip"". statistically speaking, it has to end soon right?",1
This can get to $295-6 eod easily,0
retesting the 288 low making a W and rocket to $320,0
This drop is the equivalent to a $40 drop pre-split. Does not make sense. No bad news only upcoming meetings therefore I see no other way but for this to go up and a lot higher. So in my opinion Cover your short before it covers you 6 feet under 310 by close?,0
Can easily come back to $300 eod,0
If we don’t get a J.Powell bounce this looks like 270 is the next stop.,0
Price targets so high yet it’s trading so low ….,0
"How dare the poor hold on to a $400 price target stock when it’s currently $300. Before we allow it to rise we need to shake the poor out. So we can buy at a discount.  Imagine the nightmare if the middle class pay off their student, mortgage and loan debts. How will we afford our yachts?!",0
not worried unless it breaks 288,0
"This will bounce back, the people posting bearish shit are just trying to scare you into selling your shares at the bottom.",0
All day people are frickin idiots …. Let it rip to 295….,0

"it’s funny how people are calling this a meme stock. Just cuz u fomo’d here that doesn’t make it a meme stock. It’s a 700B company that is growing exponentially. Kinda reminds me of Tesla and the run it had.  When a stock like NVDA drops 7% on no news, you buy the dip! This will run back up to the 290s (possibly 300) to bring itself out of the oversold region",0
"sheesh, go away for a couple of hours and my puts are up 120%. I can't wait for tomorrow!",1
"if no bad news regarding company,no change of fundamentals and price go randomly down more than 5% its just market selloff.But stupid people think that their company is going to crash and close the door.And thats reason why so many bears here...",0

but more stocks thanks for the discount shopping.. all I want for Christmas is more NVDA shares.. thanks,0
Added 5 more at 288 adds up to 10 shares. I will add more if it goes below 270. Long!!!!,0
looks like my $270s price target reached. My lower price target is $267-66. If that breaks then $230,1
"If you set a lower low in the premarket, does it count? Is that the signal that sends Nvidia back up to a lower high of 320? 315? are we going to bounce? Started buying the dip late yesterday.  I have more dry powder. I am bullish today.",0
My average is 189 a share ! I feel pretty good about that. I might average up if this goes below 250. Its all about getting in at the lowest price. Let the suckers buy high,0

it’s crazy that y’all think this is bad. This can still drop another 50% on a very bad day 💀,1
why did i add at 331. Now i got no more paper. Such a shame. I felt it may do this but a lot later. Hope it carries on tanking till payday.,0

Not a big secret tomorrow 🤷  *No rate hike in December *Faster tapering that will end purchasing by late 1Q or mid 2Q next year *Rocket boosters set for an EOY Santa rally *Witching on Friday may be a nothing burger since most stocks and ETFs are well below their max pain for Fridays expirations  Next week should be very GREEN,0

- why so bullish on Nvidia even in this downturn?  Comparing NVDA to any other semiconductor company is like comparing apples and oranges. Sure Nvidia is expensive compared to companies like Intel. It should be.   If Nvidia is just a semiconductor company then go ahead and call Apple a mobile phone company.  Future is bright!,0

$325 is easy target for tomorrow. 📈📈🚀🚀💰💰👈✅,0
320 would be a reasonable EOW target considering that would still be 25 bucks off ATH.  Happy I added calls on those dips under 280. 200% gain on Dec expiry so I'll probably sell before witching hits us Friday.  New buyer here. A trader not investor.,0
nice reversal today. Buy the dips tomorrow. Will eventually retest 325-330 resistance. GL 🚀,0

"AI is transforming the personal vehicle experience. Vehicle development cycles have traditionally lasted around two years, and the end product is fixed with the technology it rolls off the manufacturing line with.  A centralized, software-defined vehicle architecture built on high-performance compute, such as NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, is richly programmable, streamlining development, and can continually improve over time.  In the next year, more automakers will move away from their traditional manufacturing practices and architect vehicles with high-performance compute headroom and full-stack software from the start. As a result, next-gen models can benefit from new apps and features, via over-the-air software updates, so the vehicle gets better and safer over time.  Automakers have already pledged to increase the share of electric vehicles in their fleets, while newcomers begin to roll out cutting-edge production EVs.",0

"What are my Dec 23rd Callers expecting? I need this thing to reach into the $310's to come out positive tbh. But I might be willing to except some smaller losses in the $305 range if needed. Otherwise I'll let it expire, no mercy.   Taking the above bias away, I do think we'll see a rebound next week, even though it's Christmas week. Last year looked like this... week before Christmas, held firm $133-134. Christmas week, dropped starkly to around $129's. Weeks after Christmas, upward spikes to $131-$135.   Personal opinion is we might be ""a week ahead"" of the activity from last year, assuming it repeats similar trends last year. Meaning jumps up, including to higher than what was seen going on last week ($320's). Which is a very dumb assumption tbh, but I've got not much else to think about on this anyways, other than the fact its been shorted most of the week and probably has a large Cost to Borrow by now as well.",0

"@Bknwle_R @Terrordome @Skevaboy I never claimed it won't go this low or lower. In fact so far this dip for me is like nothing out of ordinary. Yes it's possible to to dip below 250 but even then the stock performance still remains very bullish long term. The only thing that can make me change my bullish position is if  start to report less than expected performance in their quarterly reports. Anything else like rates, notes, rotations, pandemics etc. is BS and won't affect the demand for their products and services.

I think $290 today is kinda confirmed. The market might even pull a switcheroo once Biden ends talking. Like it dumps at the beginning of speech and then pumps back up. Like what happened at FOMC. Cpuld be the opposite though. If it pumps at the start of the speech we might want to take profit.,0

"is the present and the future. Metaverse has had a lot of hype lately but it's something that will take years for many to fully understand, as well as to evaluate its actual worth/value. Don't let that particular topic distract from seeing NVIDIA's growth in other areas like gaming, mining, AI, and parallel compute power for companies.  Not gonna lie I've probably lost my year's savings with dumb ass call options, and part of that is to do with some poor timing of the market on NVIDIA. It's not that NVIDIA failed me, it's that I failed to grasp the volatility and randomness of the market, thinking I could time it, and that all investors had the same obvious (to me) bullish precedents to never allow this thing to fall back to previous areas (AKA correct).   Even if I lose everything, I will continue to invest my excess wealth into NVDA as my primary investment, though likely not with 1-2 week expiration options next time haha.   Love NVIDIA!

that is twice in 2 trading weeks that there has been a nasty and decisive rejection/selloff when this gaps over 312. this could easily test the recent lows of 265 and i will be ready with cash if it does. if not will swing small size all to the long side,0

"implied volatility is about +/- $5.25 right now.   Yes, that can change, but since we already jumped up in premarket…it seems more likely we close below $305, and above $285 with $292 or better more likely.   Yes, this can and does at times move to blow away those expectations during the day…but I would caution people that it’s not terribly likely.   This is not the day to try and swing a day-long call or put position. We have no idea what will happen after the 1st, and it would seem likely that it’s going to be more flat today than some people would like going into the holiday weekend.   It’s the type of play that iron condors were made for- low volatility plays where you can eat of the edges without needles no direction to happen with any force. 🤷‍♂️",0

Now all we need is for the 4dma to recapture the 9 on the daily & we are a go for launch Bulls.  And always watch where the 8dma lands on the last candle of the daily.

It’s about collecting all the premiums from both calls and puts.  That’s why I advise to be careful on every Thursday as hot bed for wiping out any premiums for both sides.  This time Santa are looking at calls .. play with caution.   That’s why put the expiration to longer date to reduce the impact on your portfolio.   Let’s ready to attack and push back mofo out of here.,0

"why are people buying this at 52-wk high? They're losing key engineers for the Apple car, which won't be ready for years, expect delays too.   They lowered guidance on iPhone sales and delivery,  They locked in the 3nm chips with tsm but those are massively delayed. I don't see the short term upside.",1

"Wow : what a bullish week to end!   We have broken ATH many times today with strong battle against bearish team despite inflation data. I have advised bearish and bullish team to look at the VIX very closely which allows you to invest wisely with caution. Apparently, most short and bearish didn’t listened .. I did my best to tell them.   Anyways, let’s focus on next week game plan.  $183 mark is very nearby. It’s bound to break next week with all WS very confident pushing and leading this stock on its way to 3T mark.  Please be reminded that once you touch 3T .. it’s not advisable to short nor place puts. There are lots of room to rally past 3T .. it’s surely to pass 3.5T to 4T in matter of no time due to new sales pipeline coming out .. most likely the rally will extend to next year.  Just follow 10-k which is a blueprint for AAPL growth. You can see lots of room for the stock towards 4T mark.  PT next week is $180 to $186  Let’s fucking go!",0

It’s world that put money in it.  Any FUD or FOMO .. I would say GTFO because it’s already old news since they are priced long before and it’s already recycled .. no need to tell us.  We all already prepared for both good and bad news. We will change anything.  FYI, I do not want to buy PUTS .. why keep it simple and will focus on calls only.   It appears hitting 3T is becoming a reality. No need to try to let it avoid. A lot of investors plan to put it in Apple due to long term positive on their side.",0

"The one thing that seems clear is that at the end of most mobile phones' lives in China, their components often wind up in a dumping site, a place such as Guiyu.

Bears were throwing out too much shows like non stop since yesterday shocking rise.  Let me remind you:  This stock is NOT overvalued - read 10k and 10q   This stock is supposed to be 200 to 220 because all these factors - record breaking iPhone sales and Mac Book sales will be factored into it plus Apple TV content has been expanded.   During these 6 months consolidation in feb to aug- they were going thru a lot of development and planning before the take off on Aug to now with record breaking sales in Q3 to Q4   These new price at 220 - DOESNT include upcoming announcement of Apple Car plus physical AR / VR displays.  The 200 to 220 is just a base stock price of what happened in 2021 year.  So this stock is likely to hit 300 earlier than expected in 2022 no question given AR / VR will be factored in there.  So .. always look to 10Q and 10K …  No need to do a lot of bear dancing. It’s boring lol I have already blocked a lot of them before this post. Sorry bears!,0

And dont listen to this “dont buy at ATH” shit - every stock sets an ATH, then eclipses it eventually, and some keep doing it over and over…the ONLY solid rationale for selling an investment is when the money can be invested somewhere else to make better returns - if you’ve got that, go hard, if not, why?",0

"Here's my prediction there will be huge sell offs today and this thing will crash. In the last 3 weeks, this stock has gained over 20% probably closer to 25-30 now. That is unrealistic even for a company like this. I'm not saying I dislike Apple, but this is just so over extended, there will be quite the pull back.

I ask you .. did you read the fundamentals ?  Apple is still making profit and giving you dividends plus share buybacks and got a strongest approval by Warren Buffett  Does that stock worth a big drop?  Is Apple declaring bankruptcy or what?  The answer is NO. We are being fed with lots of lies by bears ..   Just keep in your mind .. this is temporary drop because Fed changed the plan so business change plans and this is normal ..   It will bounce back to 185 and break 3T with different directions. Apple has historically broken its high with or without tapering. You can see the pattern ..   Why the fear?

Remember AAPL has a very solid financials with lots of cash and dividends.  Robust sales records never seen before due to high demand.   It’s just they want to reap the profit with negativity on omicron by shorting this stock.  This stock is not over extended given the performance is just mere less than 40% - very reasonable.  PE still reasonable -31 .  Tell me what reason you need to short this company ..   I see none other than you want to spin FUD and FOMO and omicron.  This is enough !!!,0

"@Tradebizzz @Booooooooooob @Tradebizzz  I hope this gif helps you to kill your 21st finger.  Being emotional when trading is always dangerous, in both directions. I learned for myself.   Long or short, if you are good to trade enough to play in both ways, good for you. Mi brain doesn't allow to me to work in both sides on a share. I read you a few posts before. You said you used to be long here and shorting this you have recovered the mostly part of your losses. If this is true, wow, good for you. My envy is huge. But you have to admit, aside from the huuuuge short attack of HF here  that their ""interest"" in Clov is really strange.   too touched 6 dollars. I wish I was one of the braves who bought at 6.  Now you have about 1 dollar/share to earn if you continue shorting. HF are washing their naked shorts positions, they won't continue eternally.

Look for it to potentially and briefly test the 200 EMA tomorrow then a reversal after it has shaken the week hands. I’ll average down if it hits 200 EMA because it definitely will bounce off it. Probably run 50-$100 plus tomorrow and or Wednesday. Amazon will have a Santa rally after it has taken the weeklies money that sold today. It was too many bulls and Amazon always throw curve balls. Ima bull but made 25k today on Puts. Now I’m holding calls. Should be up close to $100 by EOW. We shall see,0

told y’all stop using leverage or this is the result. Watch us go back over 50k tomorrow. Billions liquidated. That’s what you get for being overly greedy. I’m sure leveraged shorts are about to get burned next.,0
It's good sign. It means we can go up 40% in hours too. When no one expects.,0

Why is this crash. Buy buy buy stop selling,0

every bear should be celebrating they where shorting it from 60k that's serious profit. Congrats..why still hating...ride it up..bullish or still bearish?...keep stacking sats...,0
this is the start of the bear market. I’m still bullish on btc. But see you in 2024. Remember guys. Always stay invested and dca.,0
Everyone chill out. I’ve been in the crypto market for a while now. It’s volatile but don’t worry this will be back at ATH in no time,0

going to $39k next leg down,1
"Bought the dip here & ETH but I'm honestly hoping it dips even more. Also just a heads up, I just went to gift someone Crypto and found out there isn't a fee when sending to an email address (at least not on CB).  If there is, it's very low.  For ex; $100 of ETH had a $0.16 fee BTC was free  - in case anyone else didn't know.",0
Year end 2022.....$4.74,1

anyone that thinks this won't hit 60k again is an idiot. Free money here.,0
The US is facing a dollar collapse by the end of 2021 and an over 50% chance of a double-dip recession,0
ouch!  Short term bearish. Honestly I don't believe I will do any buying until there's a clear bottom. I think winter is coming guys.,1
El Salvador’s leader is a crook. Only crooks like crypto,1
. $eth.x you guys are f****** up the whole crypto market...,0
deserves to be at 39k 🥂,1
cryptos are starting to look like a covid-play stock.  BTC was ~$5400 on March 2020.  😬,1

Nice fucking up the crypto market for no reason whatsoever,1

Perfect time to buy! It’s like a Christmas sale!! CyberMonday!! Get those coins! Metaverse and more! I’m going shopping!! 🚀💥🚀,0
the sad part is that it’s still in a trading range. This didn’t even start to dip yet,1
REMEMBER 47K IS THE STRONGEST SUPPORT.....BREAKING IT MEANS ITS HEADING TO THE 30s. US HAS STARTED WAKING UP AND THE REAL PANIC WILL SET IN.....THIS WILL PUSH IT BACK INTO THE LOW 40s......THE WE KNOW WHAT HAPPEND NEXT. SNIPER CLOWN HAS SPOKEN...BULLS CAN LAUGH AT THIS PREDICTION. I'LL JUST KEEP DRINKING.......,1
"y'all crack me up... even if it goes to 42,000..... we were just there three months ago LOL..   In 21 we went to 65k to 35k back to 65k now to 42k to what..... New all time highs in 22? 100k+",0
i am buying bellow 40k,0
ANY more questions? I called the double top. Lemme guess? This is a “buying opportunity” Bitty will have counter rallies but the crash has barely begun.,1
Keep buying the dip and it dip further…………,1
Are the powers that be making damn sure the market is full of fear to drop the price of this?,0
"this is going much lower than $46,000. Don’t be like El Salvador and buy the dip too early. This is the first dip to the dipty dip.",1
Oh another btc buy opportunity. Same old same,0
damn look at this pos! Lol,0
Bitcoin destroys the earth. All of you that know that and still willingly invest here deserve to lose,1
2017 dip...exactly. pay attention bitty about to run,0

"Biden destroyed our economy, it is up to us to BUILD  BACK BITCOIN",0
man this needs to be the dip before the rip,0
"sell now, pay taxes in April or wait for Biden’s IRS to come knocking",0
Bitcoin was created to counteract massive overprinting of money. Over 30% of all USD in existence has been printed in the past 20 months.,0
"there it goes, back in the 40k range",1
"the IRS is salivating over crypto gains. This ruins their plan for short term tax revenue, which they covet so badly. Isn’t the Biden admin banking on crypto to fund their agenda?",0
Nothing decentralized about a coin that is majority owned by centralized banks and organizations. Buy whatever is good to ya but just my observation.,1
"Expected with asia seeing the mess gensler had created in scaring retail. Hopefully we can hold this level. Talk about shooting the golden goose....SEC and FED are negligent and derelict in not working this regulatory issue out. Not to mention the tough times for all with this pandemic, they now have to go and wipe out over 500bn of peoples value. Longer and stronger!",0

it needs to break 47620$,0
"If you depressed it will affect to your health and your behavior plus damages in your family relationship. Keep calm, learn from your mistakes and move on. Gradually stay away from this stock market and greedy investment like crypto. They bring more stress in life than return of investment money.

I can’t be mad at bears right now.. I also want to go down for a good entry point… lol,0
ALL CRYPTO BRING ATTACKED. NO COIN SAFE THIS MONTH. NIGHTMARE HOLIDAY SEASO,1

"If you buy youir coins on margin, you are going to absolutely get clapped here.  Everyone else shouldn't be panicing.   Buy more every week.  Average down, average up...fuck the PA.  You belive crypto is the future, or you dont.   You hold, or you dont.",0
It was never worth anything to begin with. The blockchain just stores the database. The mining just creates new coins. AND THE COINS ARE WORTH NOTHING.  Greater fool theory has to run out at some point. Let's hope it's here.,1
The brutal 55% correction from April to July took  to $29K and lasted about 100 days. A similar episode would take us to $31.5K in mid-February before bull market resumes. Probably a worst-case scenario.,1
but Cathie Wood said this would be 100k at the end of the year...I guess everyone was supposed to get a pony too..,1
bought 2000 more this a.m.,0
Crypto will be the biggest bubble burst od this decade,1
you’ll only see what you want to see when charting this. flip. a. coin. but not a bitcoin,1
via Crinton analytics using StratAnalysis.  We should 63.2% uptick in 72-82 hours.  This was predicted via combo events and Crinton type A hypothesis,0
so per StratAnalysis the bottom was triggered via Crinton equation . 63% in 72 hours,0
getting ready for that 100K 😄,0
"btc has died again my dearest sympathies , somehow this thing has died like 300-400 times, keeps coming back",0
like this is something out of left field from any kind of crypto,0
Isn’ this exactly what’s been predicted over the last 30 days a full RSI swing 47k-95k. 🤩🤷‍♂️,0
we are at 47 k not 4.7k … i remember buying at 3k i remember buying at 270 $ 😂😂😂 instis want to fill their etf s cheap !!!,0
80k coming by next week or year end.,0
this ain’t the dip boys. The dip is under $25k. Hold the line.,1
Bitcoin in thin air *poof*,1
"surprised, America isn’t waking up and panic selling",0
remember the dollars in you’re bank acc just sitting doing nothing are actually cut in half,0
lol now the bears are back alive if it will grow 20% you are quit everytime go f* yoursef,0
was 70k the top?  Is this bear market?  Be careful.,0
"- I'm taking a nap. But think about this:  The people who compare crypto to ""dot com bubble"" are either very foolish or very uniformed.   You're talking about apples and oranges here.

<$1000 by 2030,1
wasnt bitcoin like 5k not even 2 years ago...calm down peeps...companies investing 400million at a time...im sure they know what they doing.,0
nobody wanted this shxt in the $60k’s or the $50k…so why are our people buying at $47k?  🤦‍♂️  Wait till it drops to $20k at the least.  😂,1
good time to buy a Bitcoin? Or wait?,0
This is a good opportunity to block all the newbies to crypto. Lol,0
get ready for the FED to taper interest rates… to “fight inflation” to “help fix economy”  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ ok basically all you rejects complaining who didn’t get in on time cause you have almonds for testicles listen up… over the course of the next 6 months to a year you have a huge huge buying opportunity be mindful tho next bitcoin halving is right around the corner 2023-2024!! 😑 I’m going to ruckn retire soon!!!!,0
after a 25% dip day bears really think it’s going lower 🤣,0
nasty bear flag forming. I’d say a retest of $20k is possible,1
back to 29k,1
well the next halving is 2024 anyway lol,0
Should see it hit 38k at worst before it takes off again,0

I really suspect most of the uptick chatter about BTC is now about buying more. So watch out bears!,0
I Bought A Car with Bitcoin yesterday - now owner don’t want to give me the title because he’s down 9k 😂😂😂😂,1
my $4400 btcs looked expensive a long time ago even after a crash,0
"this dumped because of this   1500 BTC were dumped on spot, add on the cascade of long liquidations = this is a clear buy. I added at 44k",0
Be smart the chart looks terribly weak right now. I think we won’t see major buying pressure till we are back down to 38-40k and then hopefully a big bounce and back to 100k early next year.,0
So basically on the daily  the gap fill down to 1st support and it bounced. Still in uptrend. The last dip reset the RSI and took it to ATH next will be $75K it's a buy here... IMO,0
"crypto is still and it's infancy, like I've been stating it's getting Mass exposure especially throughout this year. Volatility is part of the game. But nothing's going to stop it.",0
why does Michael Saylor wants people to buy all the time?  Worth millions?   Then why not keep quiet and buy more himself?   Ponzi,1
just need 1 whale to ape in to start triggering the liquidation of shorts. Massive green candle imminent,0
Imagine trading sideways for 2 month then ETH who has been on a tear is still moving down less than you,0
we are set up for at least 40k levels in a week or so.,1
trying not to act suspicious when the wife asks how's the stocks doing,0
can we get to 30? Too many folks are holding strong.. pushing me off. Lol,0
"this is what happens when you dump 1500btc on the spot market . I imagine a big short was put on just before, either that or the seller knows nothing about slippage. This is a great opportunity to buy. This is nothing more than a whale selling out. This will rebound hard imo. A week ago 99% of you would have loved to buy at these levels .... So .... Buy it before it's back above 50k again and heading to ath",0
I explained Bitcoin drop and what’s next,0
how many bulls went to bed last night thinking this be 67k when they wake but instead it is 47k and still plummeting?,1
Bitcoin to 0$ 😜,1
the dip before the real run up🙌🏼,0
stayed up late last night and caught the alt coin sell wick. Paying off bigly already,0
remember when bears said this ain’t going to go past 19k again? I remember,0
this stock sucks and the CEO is a clown,1
How many times does whale has to explain that leverage can destroy your life? Whales loves to destroy any leverage players/traders.   Don't even underestimate the power of the whales liquidating your leverages.  oh by the way thanks for 1000 BTC at $42k price target.   Whale loves you.,0
"more room to bleed imo and perfect timing to stoke fear while crypto parties in Miami and we head into Christmas.  Roughly 33% retracement from the highs rn.

there’s always a dip before the rip. Nothing has changed and the squeeze will be epic.,0

"Leveraged shorts to get liquidated next. Rinse and repeat. If you follow on chain metrics it's easy to win at this. Leverage was extremely high. But zoom out, BTC is not going to 0. Too many emotional traders. LOL",0
I really hope they bring it down another 25%. I need the ST capital losses to exploit this (lack of) wash sale rule and immediately regain my positions.,0
for longtime hodlers there is still the amazing opportunity to sell above $30k.  2021 doesn't have to be a waste.,1
Yo that Bitcoin clown is on point. I hate him but game respect game,0

@DaddyChoi69 we’re not celebrating people losing money. personally i’m celebrating this opportunity. this window could close forever. truly sad for anyone who panic sold.,0

Potentially hits the yellow line. But the top white line is shooting out into the void above. Paving the path to $80K. Short term potential for bearish movement but the set up provides room to higher trading ranges.,0
You won't get your money back for years if ever on these scams.  Never chase parabolic moves.,1
48k is now support,0
so u guys were ok to buy this at 65k but u won’t buy at 47k because u think it will go lower ? 🤨🤨🤨 this is how they shake the tree everytime over and over by using one tool only and that’s…….fear.,0

They shaved off around 30K from me with this trick. But the funny part is my entire portfolio losses equate to 0.6% to 1.3% of the profits since May of this year. BTC to 14K YEAH!! CHUMPS!!!,0
you can’t hit bitcoin and not have us hit back Charlie,0
we needed this before the end of year run it’s really happening 100k,0
Heard there was another crypto piracy act...great,1
60 K...we are almost there...,1
you paper hands boys have to see it by now. Bears only come out when there is a pull back in the market to say i told you a year ago this would happen. This is healthy for the market and gives you the opportunity to buy. I bet 99% of bears here are just here to say i told you so on speculation. They have no real knowledge.,0

i did not know BTC is a stock index now apparently,0
waiting for the 43k to add,0
It’s a long game... hodlers always have and will continue to win,0
"dont be the guy in 2030 that listened to the clown 2021. maybe it got rejected 10 times at 70, but it got rejected 100 times at 48. no one knows what bitcoin will do short term. but long term it will do what its always done!",0
all the leverage leads to liquidations and that holds us down. In theory those coins are bought by hodlers and the price will go up,0
"exchange supply continues falling despite price falling. Supply shock will happen again like it did in October. No telling exactly when. Miners holding their coins from November, assuming they still are, will expedite the process. I think s2f is only delayed atm",0
good as gold…No better then gold.,0
yeah baby yeah baby we will be 60k by Friday  Preplanned manipulation at its finest 💪💪✅🚀🐳🚨,0
0.50% and it's absolutely rocking in here   Euphoric   YIKES,1
It’s not burst it’s called meta metaverse mana sand box ect,0
just a reprieve from capitulation selling   don't get too turned on,1
back at 49.000,0
"In today's markets....where we are getting hammered by a crisis-a-day.....we are starting to get immune to them and ignore them.  This will make the shtf  much sooner.   BTC is down, gold is down....yet stocks are up.  We are heading for the cliff with blindfolds on.  Just like they partied in the 1920's....the morning after will come.",0
we cross 50 again super bully,0
-X BEARS THOUGHT U SAID THIS WAS GOING TO $40k ????,0
".x Who looks at BTC with a price of 42,000 and thinks ""this is a good time , i think i will sell """,0
"the sell off was from whale games. No one was actually selling, they were just spoofing. Bull run in tact for 100k by Jan 1.",0
stimmie bump going to be withdrawn   Where will that leave us?  Lol suckers,1
"Just always remember, the price doesn't matter. As long as you don't sell, you don't lose anything.",0
rebuy at 40k,1
pretty far from where i live seems worth the risk to me,0
Ya Charlie and buffet would want your dollars in the banks so they can loan it out at 20 percent and give you .001 Buy the dip!,0
I mean biden is mining btc yeh not bearish,0
will buy back in under 10k,1
anyone else just feel that this is going to fucking explode past $70k at any time?,0
so news leaks that biden is mining bitcoin and we stay stuck????,0
Even JP Morgan - probably the world’s most bearish big institution - say $146k. It was never going to go there in a straight line.,0
50k is coming it is inevetable,0
"here is what I don’t understand: BTC went down from 63k to 29k btw May and July and then it bounced back higher. Now it went down from 69k to 49k. Higher high, higher low. Why are bears so excited? I don’t get it.",0
This price is gonna look insanely cheap before too long......,0
what happened ? Bears said we would be at $40k by today ? Lmao,0
This is all fake and a giant bubble.  237 worthless tokens sitting above 500 million dollar market cap.  Giant bubble..,1
gotta hold $49.. if $50k is broken we going back to $52+,0
this selloff is 100% driven by whales.  Retail was not selling from looking at those sharp spikes down.  Just games.  HODL we will be back up.,0
China and India fud is outdated  Japan Fud is in,0
why does crypto care so much about Omarion variant but stocks don’t give a shot this is backwards,0
"some jabroni on cnbc was talking about only putting money into low risk safe assets rn, steady predictable investments. then he goes on to say it may be a good ""geopolitical risk play"" putting money in chinese stocks and dca on the dip. are you fn kidding me?",0
"Stockmarket goes down, BTC goes down.  Stockmarket goes up, BTC doesn't move.  BTC is the market's shitcoin.",1
i bought the dip plenty ... Up now please,0
bitcoin time to be a fitcoin,0
OK. Let‘s Go.  Break 50 today and we will fly into wonderful Christmas Time.,0
"My fellow bears, we will rule this land (and this board) soon enough.  Crypto Winter is a comin'",1
Bears…You better hope this doesn’t break 50k!  Straight to 100k in Santa Rally!,0
"Next time we test 65k, it's gonna explode. That will be our fourth test",0
will go straight to 60 probably soon 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣,0
50k is thesame at 60k. Either go up and over it or its dumping to 30s.,1
everyone calling for the start of a bear market just now...as far as I'm concerned this has been bearish since hitting 69k lmao...feels like we are already 30 days into this bear market alread...  My guess is we ping pong around another 4 to 6 weeks between 52k and 40k...hopefully not lower but the major volatile pullback imo just happened  Will see,0
i would love to see big institutions start fomo . It will happen. Trillions will come to crypto,0
I was actually looking forward to this being below $40k today like the bears said so I could load up some more . Looks like they aren’t going to let anyone load up at that price,0
Struggling to break that 50k mark,0
bitty been hanging around there levels for the past few days .. consolidation ?!?!,0
I'll drag my balls across 30 miles of shrapnel just to break 50k,0

hello 50k my old friend,0
"So as you see,you guys aren't getting another dip like that right now.  You missed it. Cheers",0
52 by the end of tonight,0
either we are in a bear market with no more ATH soon and alt coins run up in the retracement or we hit close to 100k and we have 2 alt coins seasons. Either way great for alts,0
is very close to sucking all liquidity out of the entire crypto market...if this moves to 55k in the next day look for Bitcoin dominance to hit 50% again...,0
just hit 54-55k and you'll be on your way to 70,0
when bitcoin goes over 50k and no cares anymore....,0
Back on the road to 100k 🔥🚀,0
"duck this is bad. I was hoping for consolidation under 50, this means we are doomed. Everyone partying at the wrong time.",1

30 min chart shows overbought RSI and resistance at 200 SMA. Healthy pullback IMHO,0
yes! Im only losing $4000 here now! Come on bitty make my christmas!,0
Bitty needs a new compass.......she's moving around like a drunk democrat......,0
i would be getting at 50k for the upside.,0

"If crypto puts pressure on the governments to implement some of those improvements to traditional banking, and those problems are solved, people will still shill crypto because of their libertarian distrust of governments.  Their goal posts keep changing. Tech, currency, store of value, etc. When you wait for 2 weeks for JFK to show up in Dallas and he doesn't (hint, he died), and you still don't abandon Q, it's a cult. Bitcoin and crypto are a cult.",1

"Looking forward to $55,000 very soon!!!",0
we might actually end the year at $100k,0
Now with the red sign and all Here for 🩸🩸🩸 Enjoy your last month over 30k,1
They seemed determined to get it back to 54K IMO. Probably should have been obvious the moment you saw the majority of comments on this stream suggesting a crash to 28K was imminent lol. You can make a good living going in the opposite direction of overwhelming sentiment either way.,0
They have to try to read the candles better. lol,0
we ain’t selling baby. We ain’t selling,0
"Ya, short in NOW @SithUS1",0
from a bulls perspective I think that pump and quick sell off at 51.5 is scarier for us bulls than it is for bears short term. I still think we finish the year above 60,0
Bull flag.  Watch break of 51K for next leg up,0
"that 15m chart, not bullish.",1
being held down. Not selling because I know what happens next.,0
we r just getting started you f8ckssss,0
Every morning I wake up to see this POS crash. Every minute of everyday I think about the death of Bitcoin and only when it will reach 1$ worth will I be in peace with myself,1
"if you look at the chart one can speculate that if we don’t go up then we’re likely to go down, however, there’s always a chance that we don’t go down, in which case you can almost guarantee that we go up.  Over the next 17 seconds I’m bearish but long term",0
going to $55k tonight,0
stopped looking at any thing less than the 4hr chart. intraday moves even less relevant than on stocks.,0
51k next stop,0
it’s going to $20k lmao,0
"when i was just a wee lad, me and my friends frequently played outside. There was this other boy down the street that used to come out and steal our football before running back in the house and keeping it. He later on turned out to be a raging homosexual (nothing wrong with that). But the point here is, that like the boy, Bitcoin bears just want to touch other mens balls, can’t stand the sight of other people being happy, and act like assholes because they crave attention.",0
Here we go again testing at 51,0
Now there’s like 25 million people hoping it dips again so they can buy. Nobody is selling now,0

back to 60k+ this week IMO,0
While we all sleep tonight she’s probably going to hit 55,0

"This week will be a green close! It will be beautiful. The dead cat bounce will play out perfectly. We’ll come up to 55-57k. Then next week Jerome Powell aka Mr Hawkish-Him-self, is going to speak. And at the top of the downward megaphone, it will get rejected and they’re going to tank this…enjoy the gains! I closed out too early. I should have seen the rebound coming.    Go ahead and cuss at me.",1
drops don't scare me anymore. Caught the knife falling from old 10k high when it hit 8k. Been down 50% before when it bottomed at 4k. Look at it it now.,0
please halt on $52k and consolidate there.,0
they can keep printing with feather and keep buying even if the Bitcoin should be falling.  Those who are greedy stay in,0
-X 5 min chart is juicy 📈,0
if she hits 54k tonight. Might be EOD,0
@JoeStonkCrusher a picture is worth a thousand words.,0

am I the only person who feels that for the next 1-?5 years btc is a safer place to put your money than stock or property or (obviously) fiat?,0
"$100,000 by the end of 2021, they said...",1

wait for couple of 4-5K green candles back to back soon. Whales and exchanges are playing now. When the time comes you will see how fast they will liquidate the shorts.

"just like Monday night, that big buy green candle will get immediately stubbed out. Sometimes rogue whales think they can be cheeky and derail the process or fight the consensus. They always quickly get shown who's boss.",1
100k by end of year?,1
"This action isn't shorting. Shorts are much lower than they were a few days ago. This is SELLING. Smart money is exiting the market. Why hold, let alone buy, when you'll be able to buy it for 38k in a few days?",1
or wait for 48700 break to short,1
"My bet is $43K by next Monday, anyone want to take this bet?",1
"bitcoin options expire soon bulls, bears need to keep bitty under 50k to benefit the most! Squeeze on! Let's fuck them up😂",0

"bitty bitty bitty.. do something . In the meanwhile, who would have thought Russian spy connections ? Crazy how connected these people are going back to late Cold War.",0
by now probably most people who entered this year are underwater.  Tax loss selling will be a drag between now and year end,1
"price isn't that important in the short term.  Adoption, ease of access, regulation, Institutional and corporate interest, high hash rate.   Looking really good for all of these criteria.  Of course, we all want it to hit one million already 👍😁",0
zoom out you idiots.  - no zoom out more! Look at last years price,0
Now would be a good time to secure profits. Buy back in a few weeks in the 30s,1
what would happen to the price of Bitcoin if the US Treasury became its biggest holder?  With World governments taking a closer look and actually acquiring Bitcoin what would that do to a currency that was intended to be for the people and not controlled by the government...  Just curious if anyone has a sound opinion on this,0
ceo of chase bank the hater. Its probably his team doing this so they can buy cheap. All banks ceo are against bitcoin because their time have come. We will win at the end. Hold. I dont care if bitcoin will take one year to get 100k i an holding for 500k.,0
selling volume is shit. looks like a bear trap,0
lovely we will be up to 55k by Saturday,0

"I should clarify.... Bitcoin is good and solves many financial issues. I'm bullish on Bitcoin.  Coal power is bad. Do you need that explained?  Regulate use of carbon for making Bitcoin....

What the hell is happening with bitcoin  Check this one out,0
under 38-40k maybe a bear market . rn just short term price action,0

"Today: ""Business News"": Rep. Brad Sherman joked about a hypothetical mongoose coin upending the crypto world.  His jab spurred several versions of a mongoose coin trading on various platforms. ""Bitcoin could be replaced by ether which could be replaced by doge,"" he said. The Congressional hearing on crypto spurred a new meme cryptocurrency: mongoose coin. On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee questioned six crypto leaders about the benefits and challenges of digital assets. FTX Chief Executive Officer Sam Bankman-Fried and Coinbase CEO Alesia Jeanne Haas testified at the hearing, along with the heads of Bitfury, Circle, Paxos Trust Company, and Stellar Development Foundation.

loll we will back to 50k plus in 24 hours,0
whoever is manipulating btc is cursed,0
still bullish. Alts slowly detaching from BTC because literally everybody realizes this is a broader market issue. Bull run continues and this will be a generational bottom soon.,0
The liquidity vampires sucking the life out of crypto once again.,0
"Weak bounce off of major support at $48,115. Should come down lower and enter a bear trend. I don’t think it will hold, especially with CPI numbers coming out tomorrow.",1

48k first line of support.,0
"people you need to stop leveraging long positions! You will loose every fucking time, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel or just  like being a sitting duck! When are you going to learn???!",0
"i think it’ll touch the support a couple times before this thing eventually reaches new heights. sadly i don’t think this is the bottom, but it will be a big mover over the coming months. i think btc has potential to reach 70k in afew months but everything needs a consolidation period before going up. that’s just how the market works. 🤷🏻‍♂️",0
"I love money but I absolutely  despise this platform.  Full of bots, and idiots. It feels like a 2016 version of FB and that's gross.   I did some research about the owners of ST and turns out it's owned by a hedge fund.  I wonder what they are doing with all the data supplied here. 🤔😉",0
crypto equals volatility...up and down...long term up...you need to ride the waves and control your emotions and look at the end game.  It's not for swing or day trading.  Don't invest what you can't lose and you will ride them a lot easier.,0
Dip season in Crypto land. Buying altcoins.,0
b bak to 55k,0
under 48 and pack it up,1
Crypto is about to have a bad week.  People are weird.  🤦🤷,1

you moon bulls should’ve taken profits the second time it made all time highs above $60k. Pigs get slaughtered.,1
Glass Node Exchange Balance is at lowest it has been in 3 years. What does that mean? Those buying are taking off exchange and holding for more upside. Don't get fooled out of your coins.,0
LOL.  No bull on here willing to admit they bought over 50k.  Pathetic.  Enjoy the bags losers!,1
short bears have been leveraged out for a week now. It’s time for them to go,0
The good thing is there will be a lot less paper hands when we get back to 60k+.,0
I think this is the last shake out before we go higher and when we break ATH again it’s not gonna be by 2k.,0
imagine all the crypto is fake,1
quantum computing will eliminate crypto,1
inflation is also getting to bitcoin,1
buying and holding Bitcoin at this moment is pure cringe. Not taking profits over $55k is just dumb.,1
what a crash. 21k down. Wow!,1
This is an orchestrated move.....ya really think the whales are going lose in the long term????,0
Funny thing is.....when this gets back to 60's.....this time now will be quickly forgotten by Bulls.....but the Bears will remember and cry.,0
Lesson for today is to never listen to Motley Fool idiots.. they advised folk to sell bitty at $130.. smh,0
"was $9,000 higher than this in Feb 2021.",1

imagine being a bear and celebrating because you’re only down 50% on your investment and not 80%,0
Obviously the vast majority of people here were nowhere around when we dropped from near 20k to below 4k.......,0
go back above 50 you son of a motherless goat,0
Yea.....right....BTC is done..... we're all gonna pack up and go home.....Whales are gonna lose everything....all exchanges are gonna close shop.....We're all gonna hang our heads and walk back to the bank with what little we have left..... and we're all gonna learn to love Joe Biden......  Well........AINT GONNA HAPPEN !!!!  HODL !!!!  We've been here before.....,0
#cryptocrash. buy volatility #UVXY “more hawkish Federal Reserve and a mixed jobs report keeping investors cautious. The VIX volatility index on Friday spiked above 30 for its highest reading since the beginning of the year.” 🙌🚀🚀,1
Bitcoin supply is getting low… you know what that means…,0
"leveraged shorts are nothing but tools and fools, trying to sell something they don’t even own. Preying on the fears of others that actually own something, and profiting from others losses. This is the kind of behavior we need to rid this planet of . This is just not proper human behavior.",0
"why buy bitcoin when gold is a real thing and actually has real value. Bitcoin is so fake, morons.",1
46 500 support,0
TETHER IS LOADED WITH WORTHLESS CHINESE PAPER HOUSE OF CARDS TIME !,1
I really dont care about BTC at all - but if the rest of the market could get away from caring about it. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.,0
it’s consolidating . A normal dip probably to around 40k . You guys wonder why you don’t make money but you cry bear market on the dips lmao .,0
too much fud in the government right now. No one feels safe with this inflation talk and tax talk on multi millionaires. The government is basically forcing the big guys to take 10% out for taxes at least and it's causing people to sell so much more. Blame the U.S government and China for this. Nothing we can do but wait for the fud to pass.,1
"I dont want to hear any more talk of this being a store of value. 😂The coin has one use. To hold, and sell to the greater fool for profits. I'm not afraid to admit this fact. Majority of holders have no actual interest in using it as a currency for daily purchases.",1
how the headline should read. The Satoshi wallet will be a puzzle for as long as I live.,0
hasn’t even hit a fresh low from drop lol weak kids,0
"amid any large systemic risk. Bitcoin has proven to be extremely durable. Given the trajectory of the increase of the money supply,  debt and low interest environment more and more people will be seeking a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin being under allocated in most portfolios should see an influx of capital from other asset classes that dont work in this macro geopolitical backdrop. (Bonds and other legacy fixed income instruments) There may be short term downside volatily however it should inevitably make new highs at some point in the future given how the government fiat system operates and how extremely durable bitcoin is. Its harder than gold protected by the most secure computer network, that holds all transactions on a public ledger. This network is being secured by the worlds largest hashing network that is being powered by a very large % of it being renewable. For you noobs out there, Bitcoin is the most secure.",0
"47,250 is the level to watch right now.",0

they just want people to sell for a loss before running it again. Don't be dumb 💯,0
If you're bearish in BTC is because you don't really know what it is about,0
bring it to 0. Damn Onlinepoker Coins,1
Bulls need to realize that 47.2k is very important to stay above or we can free fall. I really hope we stay above.,0
Lol the bears..... Fucking Christ.   This IS NOT GOING TO FALL BELOW $45K ON THIS DIP NO MATTER WHAT.   Look at the full chart & year...... ZOOM OUT. What are the bears seeing that I'm not????? The only way you retards will get in under $45k is when the halvening happens at the end of next year 😆 and even then that's questionable as BTC will be like $200k per coin by then 🤣🤣🤣,0
"-X nobody knows nothing here unless whales move...on the long run, BTC will worth $$$. Now it is a patience game until those whales move",0

"All these analysts and crypto Pro’s claim BTC will go to 100,000 or 200,000 or 500,000.

"People who say BTC is a ""scam"".......Haven't got a clue as to what BLOCKCHAIN is.  They couldn't explain it if ya gave them a month.  They just automatically jump in the ""scam"" mindset.  Kinda reminds me of people who follow CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of MSM.   Yea.....and Biden voters...",0

"The key of investment is to select assets that have a good long-term potential,  to NEVER sell at loss… and to be patient. Bitcoin is here to stay. It is more and more adopted and used as an alternative investment vehicle and paiement mean. Free world countries want to regulate it, not to ban it. Its future is bright, so stay cool and do not worry about the rollercoaster short-term volatility nor the « experts » telling you that it will reach 200k or 2k in a few months.

It is very sad to see bitcoin not holding price this xmas.   The world needs to get off the dollar system and this is the best way to do it.  I hope it recovers and makes new a  ATH in 2022.  The dollar is a weapon that the USA is using via sanctions. Wake up!,0
"First, I <3 crypto and the tech, but is anyone else bored of  dragging all crypto around.  Feeling like BTC will eventually implode?

So's hiding cash in a mattress.    -decentral/democratized? seems like the institutions (once again) are the ones making the $.  -mining / Proof of Work is just silly  -barrier for entry for the layperson is still high (e.g. my mom is computer  and investment savvy, but would still need a hand holding crash course)  -etc    Blockchain is a awesome tech, and there are definitely some interesting use cases out there and emerging, but i still feel ""we have a great solution, but yet to find a problem that it solves better than the current solution.""

"Bears love to call it a mania or tulips...  Yet they were the ones paying $500 on ebay for a 8 roll of toilet paper during the jump of the scamdemic, lol.

They just have ST accounts.  :-)",0
"bitcoin had near term peaked on i believe the last 2 or three CPI reports. Cant recall exactly, but November 10th BTC hit 69,000 then dumped.. to be an interesting day for crypto.   I don't see bitcoin as a hedge to inflation....yet. I think in the end? Thats exactly what it will be. Just not yet.  More adoption needed- and adoption occurs primarily in bear markets. Either way, ill buy the dip. If we enter a crypto bear market? I'd say one year tops before the entire market rallies to reach all of these crazy PTs folks expected to occur this year.   (Never expect something in the investment world. Its silly. You'll be disappointed every time if everyone expects the same thing. Btc would have shot to 120k the first week the world began to expect 120k if it were that simple. Expect the unexpected, and nothing else)",0

they really want the price down for the options… if we manage to have this high this fly,0
When this shows up 5% in a few hours it will release the animal spirits and there will be a lot more buying. I don't know why it works that way. Nobody relies on research anymore just momentum trading I guess.,0

I feel this is bitcoins moment to do what it was created to do. This will go up. Give it a bit more time new ath in 2022. Don't forget that our gov is trying to STOP inflation by PRINTING money. Hodl,0
the only thing worse than holding an asset that cost less than what you bought it it at 1 month ago is  Regretting that you sold an asset for much less than it’s worth in 1 year from now. Don’t live life with regrets. Buy bitcoin.,0

"Last time this dipped to 30- I listened to FUD and waited it through and didn’t get in. Now I can see this pattern, not missing out this time before this releases- just bought the dip.",0

Why is Bitcoin dropping so mush the worse i seen yet in just a week all crypto Down every coin down When will it bottom out and start a rebound,0
I mean they just keep attacking Bitcoin for the inevitable bottom and then it all gets bought up again. Really isn’t much of a concern,0
under 47k and we have a huge problem,1
when inflation kills the dollar we will adopt Bitcoin and it will skyrocket,0
How long can tether coins keep this up,0

bear markets are traders markets...all I've been seeing all over is sell the 10-15% pumps...so be it...got several more weeks of this shit...should find a bottom over the next couple months but don't be looking for new ATHs any time soon,0
some of u are just angry at life  Your anger and refusal to sell won't save this market,1
if 47.8 turns into resistance this thing will die very quick.,0
i believe historical analysis and STF are officially out the window. Even the 4 year cycle possibly. Still,0
were all bullish long term but for the next month.. not so much. 30k area is right around the corner. These flash crashes that happen usually we get a slow dip period for another 2+ months after that and then it ramps up for new all time highs. Assuming since we flashed crashed last week we will be in a downtrend for about 1 or 2 months and then we will slowly make our way to 70k which will then recreate the same cycle,1
100k takes alot of coiled spring you know.. 😁 volatility with btc is like a volcano and we are soon to erupt,0
and then back to 49 lol,0

holding short. under 47 we could go to under 40. If it goes lower than that then maybe finally get to the 20k long target . Holding that break out retest for now.,1

CATO endorsement sounds positive big interview pending.   They are the most respected advocates and with a great rescind of pushing  policy and regulation to be fair..

"Let's just be honest and say no one knows exactly what's going to happen. What I do know is the supply of BTC and ETH keeps dropping and institutions keep increasing exposure. So, using common sense tells me this down trend is probably temporary and healthy.",0

Tell me if you think bitcoin will never hit an all-time high ever again?,0
this is the price we pay for 24/7 trading & volatility. it works both ways,0

back over 50k incoming,0
"you can lead a horse to water but can’t make them drink.   BTC is risk-off, if you scale in daily, which you’re able to accomplish with as little as $1 daily purchases.

my theory is everyone behind the creation of bitcoin sits there and plays with retail to test our emotions and when it seems like it's all over they let it fly and the ones who have true patience and believe in btc and crypto are rewarded. everyone knows it trends higher with time but our human emotion gets infront of the macro view causing retail to sell to whales. which makes them only more powerful. they make these h&s patterns . wyckoff patterns everything to make it seem like it's over but then it rallies . quite fascinating and just a random theory i've had.,0

"Don't listen to anyone saying you are weak or paperhanded for selling in the green. Just remember, this swings wildly, it's very manipulated by the same people that manipulate the regular markets. If you can't stand that, a not foolproof but solid thing is to sell when it gets close to ATH. You may miss the rip after, you may not. But, traditionally it always dips aggressively between runs. You could even start scaling out when it hits the mid 60's again. If you can hold for a long time or have a low entry, this doesn't apply.  But you can scour ST for any beat down ticker and it will be filled with delusional people talking shit about paperhands selling when they themselves lost 80% on the trade. It's nearly impossible to get that back, even averaging down aggressively. I don't believe BTC is the same as these tickers, but the sentiment is the same. Sell green, you win. If you can live with the balance of missing out on a 100% run just as you can a 50% drop, you did well.",0

"for everyone thinking why it’s crashing. It’s called a Fibonacci retracement, max long and short on both sides. And since it’s decentralized there’s no circuit breakers, or bail outs. That’s why they told you crypto is volatile and only put money you expect to lose, same thing as a casino. Now you will understand why crypto needs to be regulated and not a unregulated casino.",1

"everyone should sell to get bitcoin down to 5k then buy it from the miners, instead of slow bleeding yourself. Next year USA will allow bitcoin etf and then you can ride it up since you can afford to have stleast one bitcoin instead of a piece of a piece at 69k 🤣",1

"Do people really think this thing is going to rebound in a risk-off environment? Still hasn't even been regulation yet. People are dreaming.   There is no reason to own this outside of being an inflation hedge.   Crypto going to get wiped out because stocks are a better inflation hedge, AND they help the economy.",1

In the second half of November if retard bulls hadn't insisted on throwing everything into a desperate push to keep BTC in the 60s and high 50s even though it was screamingly obvious that it needed a pullback. Well, when you deny an inflated asset a healthy pullback, this is what you get: a flash crash followed by a downward spiraling downtrend. If they had just done the sensible thing and let BTC dip to 48k the week before Thanksgiving it might've gotten enough of a bounce to weather the tapering fears.",1

2022 could be a year of awakening setting up political changes in november . Truths uncovered may further validate the need for  institutional diversification out of gold into decentralized stores of value. The unwinding in gold does not have  to be drastic for bitcoin to grow by multiples . Both can coexist yet with more equilibrium. This is discounting real world blockchain applications which serve as second stage catalysts.,0
"It's kind of tragic seeing people on this ticker discussing bullish scenarios, metrics indicating a bottom, and how BTC is going to break resistances... while Powell's speech is less than 12 hours away.

bro... fuck leveraging... do it straight up. They're killing off all leverage and trying to liquidate quick.

Zoom out on whatever crack pipe time scale you are looking at. We are probably at one of the most crucial points of the bull run. It's decision time.

I think we're about to enter into a new uptrend and I'm targeting 78K in 6 weeks. Tried out 100X Futures with 35X leverage to give me some room at a spot of 47K. Already up 160% so far. I think I might go a little heavier on the dollar amount next time. Will see how my position in doing in a couple weeks.,0

come on Bitty i know you want to break $50k tonight,0
"We're getting paid everyday at our jobs in USD. A piece of paper. That is constantly being printed with literally ZERO physical asset(s) backing it.   Who in the fuck actually has the audacity to say crypto is worthless when many coins are simply following suit of the long existing, inflating Fiat principal's.   Oh, and of course the same retard boomer/bear bitches crying or tagging Bearish on CRYPTO AS A WHOLE are the same ones that don't know of the MANY MANY MANY asset backed coins -- an asset backed crypto instantly renders any and all existing Fiat currencies obsolete. Period. Welcome to the future.   A wise man once said ""living in the past doesn't change the future -- living in the past merely ensures you will not be a part of the future""",0

"Bitcoin did not die in 2013, not in 2017 after the major crash not in 2020 after covid why should it die now? Now that they include crypto tax as a source of income to fund the infrastructure bill, big corporations are buying it, big funds and banks are in the process of making it available to their customers. Think about it, do not be naive. Bears are stupid as rock. They are done. It has bottomed out now they have to cover.",0
will test 40k again,1
"Amazing. After losing more than 30 fucking percent off its value in a month, this trash coin can't even match the DOW or SPY on a green day, and then immediately starts throwing all its meager gains overboard as soon as the markets close. But next time markets are red for the day, it will drop 4 times harder than stocks. And China hasn't even woken up yet. Back to mid 46000s by morning.",1
I know it’s old to talk about Taproot. But the upgrade means that Bitcoin will be used more for Smart Contracts (ex. NFTs and DeFi). When it’s used it locks up coins effectively reducing supply.,0

people will continue selling till January due to hedge funds and major investors calibrating their investments for year end. Nothing surprising going on here. Following the same chart patterns as 2013 and 2017. Once they’ve finished reevaluating their portfolios new money will enter the market. Crypto is currently owned by the same people holding all year as far as I know but next year will bring new investors and new money. If you plan on selling make sure to buy up before January 1st,0

"- I will double down on my ""BTC is not a hedge claim"" by exploring additional systemic long-term risks.  BTC mining is coming to an end.  At that point, supposedly, no more BTC will be ""printed"".  If that holds, then BTC will be an expensive way to hedge inflation.  Every transaction will have a BTC fee, else the ""miners"" will not mine crap.  Right now, I can transfer millions of dollars over thousands of transactions for literally no fees at all, and subject myself to inflation risk, or I can do the same thing with BTC and incur a massive fee to do so.  ETH is worse.  Compound your daily spending or monthly spending  with what will be increasing fees to x-fer BTC (ironically, at a pace that will increase with dollar inflation), and you're not getting anywhere.    99.9999% of the planet still can't go to the grocery store and buy a pound of ground beef in BTC.

"you can still get 1% of a bitcoin for around $500 - doesn’t sound like a lot - and wouldn’t recommend spending the $500 if you need it right now. But 10 years in the future after two more halvings and the remaining supply almost negligible, that 1% is going to be able to buy you something like a new car or maybe even more. Money is digitizing, bitcoin is the ledger, keep buying.",0
"Bears had literally all the technical momentum and bearish sentiment in the market, and yet could hardly suppress it at $45K which is pathetic.   Meanwhile all the bullish activity was taking place behind the scenes -  people accumulating, sending to cold storage, miners holding, and hashrate pushing ATH.",0

Yesterday there were plenty of “traders” bragging about buying at $43K and selling at $48K and how simple it was to see price movements. Mmmmmk sure. Keep telling yourself you’re winning with your 0.0000001 BTC trades. +fees +taxes you’ll owe.  HODLERS will be the winners in the next decade. Keep stacking SATS. My personal goal is 10 BTC.,0

"In many sports it comes down to who can juke the other player bettering in order to get the ball. What you do is you lower your weight against theirs and wait for them to commit, then you spring. This is the same. If you are uncertain, you lower your position, look for volume, make little moves if they make little moves, spring once they commit. Watch the hips, ie. watch the volume, don't listen to the trash talk, and focus.  It's better to play a good game than talk a good game. Points on the board are all that really matter.",0
the funniest part to me is people are literally saying the same pumping bullshit they did like 10 months ago for the same price that it is now. That’s a big 0% gains or even negative for most of you. Just be honest about it 🤷🏻‍♂️,1

why so much panic amongst the bear we barely went up lol,0
most of the time I hate bitty but this looks like a great setup!,0
imagine if an equity price was dictated by 6 % of the total value of an asset .... That's what's happening in BTC right now.... Eventually the supply shock will hit hard AF....the people that are making money off these swings are the exchanges that offer ridiculous leverage.... They can literally manipulated the spot price to liquidate on demand.... Regardless that will change in the coming months to weeks as liquid supply is at all time lows.... Dangerous have exchanges are playing,0

"Number of viewers on ST, total market cap, and the 90 day chart combined could give you a solid DCA plan in and of itself.

When I see solid projects that few are aware of it very much excites me.",0

"The crypto user experience is bad. Bitcoin fixes this. Once Web 3.0 and the blockchain are commonly accepted, we will move away from fiat to a BTC standard and the user experience will become joyous and intuitive, powered by pure stored digital energy.

All crypto red on Christmas Day.. Ho Ho Ho😅,1
"There are still too many big buy orders sitting at 43k and 42k. Bitcoin needs to go back down so those orders get filled if it's going to have any chance of regaining ATH. If it just stalls out and flatlines under 53k resistance, it will have too much downward momentum on the inevitable dump to bounce off the 42k support... whales will remove those buy orders hoping to buy in the 30s instead and the price will crash right through 42k support, at which point 30,000 is inevitable.  If you want bitty to do well in 2022 you should be hoping for a sell-off right now... and leading by example by cashing out all your Bitcoin.",1

"“The failure of bitcoin to become a recognised currency has been masked by the inflation in the price of bitcoin. This has created enough profits for a large number of people to jump on the hype-train of bitcoin well ahead of any real-world utility being provided.  Any increase in the price of bitcoin has very little do with its genuine utility. The growth in bitcoin’s price are only false inflations based in future speculation, that provide enthusiasts with enough monetary “proof” to make a lot of loud noises about its future.”  I agree.",1

I bet Chinese exchanges don’t have many accounts left to close.

I think the world currency should be based on 5 post cards my dad sent me. They are unique and have a supply cap of 5. The new financial system should be based on these 5 cards as it will be anti inflationary. These cards are physical and tangible and don’t cause any harm to the environment.,1

No government pump with stimulus checks and PUA unemployment plus a possibility of months before 300 month child bill which ended this month.

"so my theory on why it’s so stuck right now. MMs are trying to gain back premium. They’ve been heavily short with selling options too close to the money, and after this pump they decided they need out. what will they do? IV crush. 1-2 month out contracts have seen over 10% IV crush since today’s peak. they’re buying back their covered calls getting ready for the next pump, then they’ll sell these calls again. once the market cools off a bit, we will see another massive run from FB",0

"the more I look into the potential about the metaverse the more I’m convinced Zuckerberg is going to be the richest man in the world within a decade and by a large margin. Given the exponentiality of technology, I really would not be surprised to see VRs with the level of sophistication seen in the Matrix within a decade or two.  If you think people are addicted to being plugged in now, wait until you basically have a way to live in god mode. How could real life ever compete?",0
"When they starts lunching their meta projects, then this thing will be huge. Have you seen Mark intro video of META? He isn’t wearing any glasses or any kind of VR. They are planning something big. I’m always bullish on fb.  Love the company.",0

"Meta Platforms Whale Trades For December 13  12/13/21, 6:44 AM December 13, 2021 09:44 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Options  Someone with a lot of money to spend has taken a bullish stance on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB).  And retail traders should know.  We noticed this today when the big position showed up on publicly available options history that we track here at Benzinga.  Whether this is an institution or just a wealthy individual, we don't know. But when something this big happens with FB, it often means somebody knows something is about to happen.  Today, Benzinga's options scanner spotted 10 options trades for Meta Platforms.  This isn't normal.  The overall sentiment of these big-money traders is split between 60.0% bullish and 40.0%, bearish.  Out of all of the options we uncovered, there was 1 put, for a total amount of $26,340.00, and 9, calls, for a total amount of $326,174.00",0

This high activity led to quarterly revenue of almost $6.2 billion, growing 13% year over year. The company also has $1.1 billion in Q3 net income and over $1.25 billion in quarterly free cash flow.

oone can safety say that we are out of rotation yet.. still long term very bullish but the stock has been getting hammered. Financial looks pretty good long term values looks good but its just falling and unless we get retest at some other point.  150 makes sense. and for those who says its super undervalue its not.. the average tech sector P/E ratio is at 38.. We are currently at a great hope period where people just put money randomly and hope that it goes up.. and also we could hit a period where this stock will be under value so taking everything in consideration 150 makes sense and I will average down. If I see a huge resistant at 170 I will repost but I am not holding this while its going down..,1

"After about 3 months of capitulation, many recent payment IPOs are starting to see the light. The big players (PYPL, SQ) have fallen over 30% in less than a 3 month window. The newly listed payment cos (DLO, MQ, FOUR, EVOP) have been hit much harder - some down more than 50% from the highs.   Longer term strategic investors and short-term tactical investors may find these payment companies attractive because of the growth profile and because of an uncertain macro environment. For the most part, especially for MQ and DLO, these stocks can be incredibly resilient due to their global reach and distribution. Most importantly, all these payment companies benefit massively from inflation. Expect to see MQ, DLO, FOUR, EVOP, PAYO to outperform as the lockups are now over. Additionally, the South American payment stocks, PAGS and STNE, which have been crushed because of the political/economic situation in Brazil, are going to ultimately recover.",0

"The recent bitcoin correction down from its all-time high has had the market in a panic in the past week. However, not everyone has seen it as a bad omen. The digital asset’s price had gone down below $60,000 causing investors to believe the bear market has arrived. Most investors has been hit the most by panic as sell-offs happened through the space. Nevertheless, the correction was bound to happen following the incredible run that bitcoin had. Market corrections are always normal and expected after a bull rally, that is why it is reasonable to ride the bear market with a working strategy from a professional. I earned $42k in 30 days following the guide and instructions of Zev Paiss, his trading system and strategy is the best i have seen. Y'all can reach out to Zev here on stocktwits @Industrialhemp or whatsapp at +1(720)213-8390 for enquiries into a profitable system rather than just following the hype and all..",0

Just imagine, Tesla stock would be nearly $1500 or more per share right now if it weren’t for the fact that Musk has no choice but to sell these shares to pay his up coming tax debt and to avoid paying millions in additional tax, due to the new Tax Regulations beginning 2022.

"it’s interesting how no news came out today about the strong sales in China 🤷🏻‍♂️ market trying everything it can with any little stupid insignificant news to bring down the stock. Tesla will continue growing immensely. 2 New factories opening up this month, in plans of building in India and another one in China. Cyber truck coming. Semi-trucks coming up with order already in place for Pepsi, Walmart and that’s just the beginning . let’s not forget the new roadster and this is just the car business let’s not also forget autonomy, robot taxi, insurance solar panel energy storage Tesla has revolutionized the car industry. It’s a shame and a disgrace that the government can’t  acknowledge what Tesla has done that shows us how corrupt things really are but w/e 1500-2000 will happen again. Split will happen again. Long term short term Tesla it’s a great company to trade for the next decade. I’m happy the world has someone like Elon musk. Oh and SpaceX  is on the way.",0

Stop at $1000.     Let's see what unfolds.     if $980 is lost next week, will be shorting down to the gap fill which looks like a serious possibility now.

"When the dust settles, plummeting 10yr is the single most important macro booster for this stock. Global demand (we will see a record print in China on Tuesday) has been unabated through the pandemic and any resurfacing of pandemic fears will keep rates down and alleviate the supply chain issues (muting reopening pressure on supply chain). Just like 2020 (height of the pandemic) provided a perfect runway for this stock, there’s a high probability we will see a repeat this shortly. No doubt the stock is off a few $100 from peak largely due to 10b5 sales which are mostly used to pay tax on options exercise that will actually increase Musk’s holdings in the shares. That’s different than Bezos taking money off the table. The sell off Friday was most likely triggered by traders using the contradictory  messaging on rates from the Fed vs unemployment data combined with pandemic fears as an opportunity to cause a panic sell off in Nasdaq.",0

"what if 12/9 is a multi event day (stock split and more)? Knowing Musk, he loves to set up mega squeezes before major events. His stock selling to cover taxes for options exercise is a perfect bait for front runners on the short side. He’s only 60% done and all recent sales are non discretionary suggesting something is afoot. After 12/9, he could dump the rest assuming the event creates a mega squeeze we saw last year, with volume not being a factor. Stock is cheap on fundamentals alone in the event 12/9 doesn’t materialize, especially with 10yr dropping.",0

"I just have to correct so much misinformation I keep reading over and over here.  Elon is not “getting out” of TSLA stock.  He is not even reducing the amount of shares he’s holding.  He has tons and tons of option contracts.    All Option contracts have expiration dates.  He HAS to “exercise” them (by paying cash to turn them into shares) or just cash out of them. He is using the value of some of the option contracts to pay for the shares he’s keeping.  So by the time he gets done doing this, he will have many, many MORE shares of TSLA than he did previously.   If you can’t grasp this, don’t feel bad.  Chamath P. doesn’t get this himself, and his IQ is probably above 100. (He has recently sold out of his company’s positions because smarter people than him (Elon) are doing it.",0

my financial advisor texted me on Friday from Edward Jones and said to hold onto my Tesla shares. He said Elon is a genius and to keep adding when I could. I asked him about share price.

"Tesla (TSLA) PT Raised to Street High $1,580 at New Street Research on 'Multiple Strong Catalysts'  via @Street_Insider   New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu raised the price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to Street High $1,580.00 (from $1,298.00) while maintaining a Buy rating, citing multiple strong catalysts.  The analyst comments ""Continued ramp despite supply challenges. Through great efforts of sourcing teams, Tesla has been able to continue to ramp production despite chip shortages. Visibility nevertheless remains very limited (one month at a time). Supply will be the limiting factor in 2022, not manufacturing capacity. The ramp will continue if the situation begins to improve, but continued supply constraints could slow it down. Stock may look through temporary issues, as it would be supported by price and margin expansion. We would expect the market to understand the temporary nature of the supply constrains.""",0

Company researchers observed a 25-fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies that fight the variant, compared with the original strain of the virus, in people who got just two shots.

let's see... 1.sales in China declining month over month.  2.Musk sounding desperate by constantly complaining about the provisions of build back better. 3.CPI this Friday. 4.low trading volume in December while Musk still has about 8 million shares to unload before the new year. 5.Confirmed SEC and DOJ investigations. 6.NHTSA investigations confirmed. 7.Fed will be forced to raise rates by Spring.

The Nasdaq is setting itself to repeat what had taken place in March 2000 when the index began to crash from its peak. Same scenerio... under Fed Chairman Greenspan's leadership at the time, the Fed began to raise rates. Frome the peak of March 2000 to April 2000, the Nasdaq lost 34.2 percent of its value.

the people that believes Elom when he said he has no idea where 12/09 came from lol.

"@Equalipty @Smartoptions24 how are you guys buying this company at these prices…. Smh, honestly I’ve had it with this company since they decided to tease a small valuation, made their stock run up, then renegotiate to a way bigger valuation for their benefit. Now 8 months since they got billions from their spac merger they are now doing another offering of more billions. If you want to buy a EV company I’d recommend  there will only be one winner in this race and Tesla has dominant market share, multiple sources of revenue. That’s being said both companies are over valued but lcid is way more likely to fall (and fall more). If you don’t see that then I’m sorry but you’re about to lose a lot of money in the coming months",1

"In sports betting when the general public (dumb money) heavily favors one side, the pro's (smart money) will often fade the public.  The Pro's vs. the Joe's.  There is a similar parallel with the speculation of a split today.  The majority anticipate a split announcement and for that reason, I am a little skeptical.  I would tend to think the announcement would come when we least expect it to trap shorts.

clowns The day is not over yet Its fuckin 9/12 for 24 hours lmfaoo,0
even if 12/9 was nothing. It presents an opportunity for Elon and Tesla ro have a little fun and do something.,0
no reason for all this selling. Is it really going to the 50sma again for no reason? Just selling selling selling just because. That’s what market makers do. Read the Buyside by Turney Duff. He did shit like this just bcuz sometimes. Hilarious!,0
wondering if 12/9 was another 3 million share dump day,1
Looking for $1018.82 bottom,1
"@BigOBull problem is, Elon can also tank  with one dumb comment. He's brilliant and a great founder, but Tesla needs an adult CEO IMO.",0
yess I told 970 soon,1
Bullish case for this today is a close above $1035,0
"Wait so the president doesn’t like Elon ? This can’t be good for business, lots of trouble ahead. Keep on speaking out though Elon, never back down to tyrants! Still bearish but support the cause, sometimes you got to sacrifice billions in Tesla share price to send a message!",1
VWAP is at 1038.. and RSI is oversold.. why would someone sell this solid stock? Just be patient. In fact this is a buying opportunity!,0
"@TheHebrewJefe And getting better... kinda funny - I think she made a conservative statement after fearlessly jumping into  ... remember she said she didn't care about the auto business - it was more about autopilot and EV... I think it's about that and Gigafactories as a very huge catalyst to optimize manufacturing processes --> lowering cost to produce and expanding the number of optimized --> increasing gross profit margin against increased revenue.... HUGE!!!!    Don't forget that Elon is challenging to make and sell more Tesla Model 3s than Toyota makes Corollas... he needs to lower cost to produce and ramp up.    If Elon can do anything close to his goal, it will be clear that there are too many car manufacturers in the world serving customers that are moving to EV... Tesla is clearly the leader",0
YES LETS GO TO 900,1
breaking under 1k again? LOL,0
what if Elon meant to sell by this date 🤦‍♂️ fuck,1
Filling the gap to $1008 and then we climb.,0
i didnt sell at 1240 not selling now,0
Bulls better keep this above 1k🙂,1
I believe Tesla stock will split after Elon issues an official announcement in the future. Mark it down.,0

Elon probably sold some today. What a fucking moron. I am sick of his ass.,0

"everytime I look at this, its down another 10$  Garbage",1
I unironically hope that Elon announces split after mkt close to fuck all these puts and shorts,0

12-9 meant Armageddon I guess 💀📉,0

I have 500% here and people still call it scam take off 😂😂,0
The market is bad. Sold all of shares during pre-market. Hawkish Fed is controlling the market. Tech is not the place to be for a while maybe some blue chips or cash or short.,1
"this will drop below 1000, puts open interest is huge",1
call buying program making a bit of a push on 1020C,1
probably close around 1035-1038.,0
You cant even force feed someone this stock over 1000 just ZERO takers,1

I will never holds la over night because if something ever happened to Musk this would be get annihilated.,1
Elon has something up his sleeve...I guarantee it,0
if cpi is bad tomorrow expect new lows. probably sub 900,0
I remember Tesla was like 200-300 down from 1500 back then. Out of no where Elon announced the split after hour around 2 or 4 pm. Tesla squeezed up consecutive days in a row,0
850 is major support in this bear market.,1
gonna grab some short term calls. Let’s see if we can get a power hour into close. Short news always does this then it pops.,0
"you sell for loss, you lose 🤣",0
a close at this price or lower really sets it up to fall into mid or low 900s tomorrow with the expected inflation and weekend sell off.  Wouldn’t buy this stock rn. Drop to come,1
i see tesla hitting $970 tomorrow then going back to the $1000s monday,1
a close below 1k will he very nice and,1
live look at Elon split  🤣,1
dumb bull thought it would go up back to 200,1
you degenerate gamblers with your 12/9 talk lmao !!,1
winner takes it all! Elon Musk and Bears!! 😂😂😂😂,1
$1005 is the bottom imo !!   🙏🏻🦅🐉,0
"hope that these stupids,which voted for Musk to sell enjoy their stop losses",0
The thing is with this 12/9 malarkey.. even though its nonsense and far fetched.. it ain't gonna stop the stock shredding another $50 AH when there isn't any news... madness. Lol,0

What a moron of a ceo he is? He was asked about 12/9 and said nothing was happening so he clearly saw the tweets yet said nothing. Getting people hyped up for nothing. I am on the edge for this and hopefully most of the bulls should be including aunt Cathie. Don’t wana sound like a bear but what companies ceo does shit like this.,0
elon just gave the bulls a facial,1

Cathy going to be looking for a job by the end of 2Q 2022 anyone hiring,1
Better hold on to that 1k for dear life😁,1
@Smartoptions24 @Jkang2 @Equalipty I think the hype is dying down (especially the conspiracy for   on 12/9 stock split lol we’ll see tho there’s still a few hours left in the day) also from the catalyst of them starting delivery. No new catalysts coming and their value (at 30’s) is at a place where they’d be in a couple of years and if they execute perfectly. Even if it goes hire (to 70’s) I can for sure tell you that this will not hold,1
Opening $1100 tomorrow,0
so much for something awesome happening on 12/9 unless it’s still to come,0
watch when Elon unloads another million shares tomorrow.,1
ways of looking at this the 12/9 nothing burger everyone was looking for might turn out to be the drop in price to actually stack up on it which in turn gets you the chance to pickup more. Everything bleeds sometimes so relax let it do what it is going to do and strike at what you you think is a good price. What goes down will eventually go back up. I was lucky to grab TSLA in the $270 range and again just under $600 so look at it as a bargain when it settles. 💵,0

"what time are they announcing the stock split, dumb fooks?! Tesla Fanboy below...",1
Well there goes the 9/12 split theory. Any more bright ideas from those people.,0
"Anyone ever have to deal with their TESLA calls getting assigned 2 weeks prior to expiration? It's usually 1 week right? There's still so much more extrinsic value on the option, it would be foolish to exercise early.",0
could it be that Musk leaving Tesla!? So he's selling lots of shares & they talked about it in last earning call,1
"Closed below the 50MA, wouldn't rule out a rest of $980 tomorrow... support at $997 but today wasn't great by any means. CPI tomorrow aswell...",0
Hope he splits it at 7:59 ET just for the hell of it.,0

what was happening on 12/9 again? 😂,1
stock split is not a matter of if. It's just when   Don't worry about it... my guess is 1500 to 1700 q2 2022 earnings... then split,0
damn people really just want to get this stock cheap 🤑🤑😂😂 I’m still bullish see you at 1100$,0

"those who are wondering why the stock is down 22% from the Twitter poll, consider this. EM fixed daily sale regimen provides a perfect means for hedge funds to front run his sell orders. Is that good for EM? The answer is YES! He will sell 17mm shares to purchase 23 million shares. He will pay 33% tax on sold shares and 54% tax on purchased shares. He will save on taxes by driving the shares lower for 2 reasons- 1. He will forego 67% of the loss on the sold shares in exchange for a 54% savings in tax on the purchased shares. Since he will purchase 5mm shares more then he sells he will net a slight benefit which rises as the shares drop upon exercise. 2. The biggest benefit is that he will defer the tax on the exercised shares (23mm) at the reduced price that will be taxed at 20% (Texas domicile). The current tax upon exercise is 54% (California income tax). The savings are in the billions since the stock is down over $250 in a month. Way to go “Person of the Year!”",0

"Musk is not really selling stock. He’s in the process of swapping 17mm shares taxed at the capital gains rate into 23mm shares (through options exercise) taxable at the income tax rate (54% in CA). Because he’s net buyer, he’s doing everything possible to trash the price by doing these pre programmed sales. When that ends, he will have saved billions in current income taxes. The reversal in the stock will be massive, just like in the past.",0
so only another 5 million shares left to sell.... this will be fun,1
"is it just me or the bears can only see what they want to see, all bears are talking about Elon sold more shares and ignoring the fact that he bought options 2.17 million shares for strike price $6.24",0

The rest of the auto industry was years behind Elon Musk. The fact that you see every auto maker jumping into the EV world proves that Elon musk already won 🔥 Like he said they figured out the technology to allow competitors to catch up. Brilliant!! With the race to space the Hurd is looking for bragging rights to get to the tip of space when there not realizing Elon is looking at preserving human life for the next million years. His priorities are different than the average. Go Elon 🔥,0
how is this still at 900 plus.  Elon selling everything should tell you hes gone and this company will never make a profit,1
$spy Elon is selling shares to pay his tax bill plain and simple just like the other billionaires of the world. He clearly said a long time ago he doesn't pay himself a salary. When Tesla reports a profit it affects the business taxes not Elon Musk because he hasn't sold yet until now. Let's not forget come next year the new tax rate will go into affect they selling now to avoid paying more. It's a smart move and the fact it the stock is still hovering 100% higher since the split with post Elon Musk selling proves that the world believes in Elon Musk. Can't wait for the next project,0

the futures market went down at European open so this is why the literal best stock on the market is down right now.

Not a good short market will probably recover before open,0

even if Elon is selling today he’s not done at today. He’s got more to sell.  And is he did sell at that pop around 1000 questions need to be asked as to what’s going on.  There’s was a pump all the way to 1220 just before his Twitter poll. Then the MMs held it in the 1100s for him to get his first rounds sold. Now conveniently there’s a pump for him to dump into (assuming he was selling at open today).,1

Something y’all need to know about - only criminal shorts HFs have the privilege to see who’s shorting / selling via sweeps/ blocks / lots in real time because all selling goes through the same HUB (PORT) - and prearranged with actual lending of physical shares selling or just liquidating via un-hedging DP ..  Since these are the only criminals capable of such large sweeps with back up supply provided by market makers through Brokers (mistagging shares) via dark pool they know exactly if @elonmusk selling so they 20X the amount to front him !! Front running is criminal conduct known and outlined by SEC !! I hope some of DOJ is reading here .. doubt it but not ruling it out !   🙏🏻🦅🐉,0

I llike  Tesla’s cars but I do not care for the cyber truck and I’m holding off on a purchase of a vehicle until I can get an EV that suits my style.

The trick was having the mass retail population believe that it always bounces back up to 1000,1
Buy the dip and fill your bags now! Next week it will be too cheap ;-),0
only ze best one survives. Good luck,0
Wow… 880.00 price call is coming to fruition.. un f%#%g believable,1
it’s only down about 9% over the last month up about 20% the last three months still plenty of room to go down,1
I almost went all in puts this am I’m talking ALL but I didn’t I had reservations  36 in 60 bounce back?  20 chains bitch im Dana Dane,1
close below 930 u pig,1
"This stock went to $6000 dollar per share. How much more do you want, greed is a killer. Even Elon has said it’s overvalued multiple times and was confused how the market even valued his company at this price!",1
Back to $600,1
That is one grim daily candle... screaming out for $900.,0
look at all these Elon bag holders. 🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡,1
"so he still has to sell a nice bunch in these coming days.. now the issue is, will he bring it down to 880, or down to the ground basically straight to the cemetery jesus christ u need to show up in such inflationary moments like these, go tell musky to behave better for next christmas please, thank you.",0
Gap down tomorrow followed by a swash buckling northern rocket to $1000... or we plummet to the 150MA and bounce from there next week.,0
bearish engulfing on the daily. Possible gap fill to $909 tomorrow is possible,1
added more leap poots. Fed said money printer go bye bye. Didn't you Tesla Fanboys pay attention.  No more brrrrrrrrr on call options.,1
"$10 and $15 swings within minutes like it's nothing.. madness, yet fun!",0
🎯890 then 790 hopefully,1
Closed out next week 900s holding 910s and 880s for this week.,1
"there is no bull or bear.  As trader, you are here to make money.  I personally can't stand this company because I think the CEO is such an ahole. However, occasionally I buy calls as a hedge. Long term, I am bearish.",1
Expect  will fall back to $910 or wherever after hours then open green pre-market. Opened call positions towards close. Saved about 30% of my cash to average down tmrw in case the opportunity comes.,0
One thing I know for sure $1000 calls get sent to the nether room lol,1
Elon has finished his sale completely. Done 100%. Don’t ask me for any sources. I just know.,0
"these big price moves are all options plays. The 1k call expiring tomorrow is at $1. I wouldn’t be surprised if they run it up tomorrow, so they can bank on those contracts. The call volume between $950-$1000 is crazy. That’s what causes a gamma squeeze, I wouldn’t put that past anyone. If they start to run it up pre-market tomorrow, get ready for a wild run. Hedge funds love selling naked calls, so tomorrow will be very interesting.",0
Puts came in real nice after yesterdays fake rally! 👍🏻,1
I will likely (not for sure) close my short tomorrow sometime between $890 and $910 after we close the gap at $910. What a fucking gift. We all know this has red day Friday’s. This is way too fucking easy.,1
How you all be buying when the leader of the ship is selling is beyond me. Some people can't take a clue. Wait till next year when the stock is at $200 then you will sell at a bigger loss,1
getting pumped up again ahs. Looks like Musk may be unloading more tomorrow.  🤣,1
Elon sold for a reason,1
watching the price come down to reality,1
"though it will take few months to get there...around Mauly 2022, price target is $280/share after liquidity begins drying up after the Fed stops printing money in March 2022. Tesla Fanboys, you've been warned. Don't fall in love with a stock.",1
Q4 earnings and '22 outlook are going to be great.  Hold on and buy dips in the meantime.,0
860 coming tomorrow,1
bears really think this is gonna dip to $700 lol  See you at 1050 tomorrow,0
"gonna dip below 910 and fill that gap, then run tomorrow the rest of the day imo.  quad witching won't let this close below 950, too many OI puts there.",0
"Elon Musk is selling, stupid people are buying",1
"Broke support, next stop 915. Bullish Monday, bearish tomorrow, too many dummies buying OTM calls even now",1
"been a long road, trading around the position, taking profits on big dips, reshorting when it bounces.  Closed out most puts on this for now to take a breather and enjoy my vacation.",1
"buying this tomorrow April 1200s , 1250s",0
"All EV are diping now, next week it will bounce back",0
can drop 60% and will still be overpriced,1
Stop loss check  1 2. They're practicing for tomorrow.😃,1
maybe we open above 1000,0
"ugh….. despite, good loading price for those that bought at the high… for myself, planning on averaging up and adding some more",0
"if 800s are hit, going to load the boat.",0
tesla has 100% ownership in shanghai factory compared to all other car factories. Remember that,0

"U.S. new car sales to rise in 2022 on pent-up demand – Edmunds  via @Street_Insider New car sales in the United States are expected to rise next year, driven by pent-up demand as automakers in 2021 cut production due to pandemic-driven supply chain issues and semiconductor shortages, industry consultant Edmunds said on Thursday.

I am buying infinite between here and $890. Bring it!,0
Thank you so much retail investors for believing in me and my vision and  buying my bags at the pre split price of $4600-$6100 per bag! Thanks for buying my brothers bags too!  I promise that I will fly all of you to my utopia on Mars someday!,1
tomorrow we open sub-900,1
Nice 1999-2000 set up on the charts,1
"Inquiring minds want to know ... asking for a friend at 653pmest ... whytf are bulls still posting in this forum re TD 6:40PM EST 918.40 en route to sub 700, dramatically lower thereafter re due diligence? Thank dog that I am here to help. Carry on sticking forks in this overpriced nonsense for profits TESLA  🐻❤😈 @PROFIT_MAKER ✔",1
know it doesn’t mean anything but trading cheap at 302x earnings.,1
every tweet elon has ever done has been bad for the stock people need to stop defending his dumb tweets that probably have no merit to it and people trying to decipher just random crap he posts while taking a dump,0
under $900 tomorrow. Will average in under $800-$600 because who knows when the bounce will be. But there will be one. And blood for now.,1
ooo after hrs low adds up to blackjack 21 ah low : 916.50,1
i blame Biden and SEC letting these hedge funds rig the market starting off with GME and now mega cap stocks the movement for a lot of FAANG stock has no rhyme or reason to it except options controlling it what a pos and now going to ruin my  moon for the Christmas holidays     i like how this just easily reverses almost 100 points in a day these guys just like to suck in retail bone dry setting up bunch of bull traps after trap,0
LETS GO BRANDON. Said no Tesla shorty ever. Bunch of Brandon lovers.,0
elon went against the democrats.... gg,1
$868 next level,1
"The FAAMG trade is looking very last year. Retail investors aren't flocking to the trade, which includes buying shares of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet. This group has been wildly popular among investors in recent years and has helped drive the market higher.  Individual investors are instead favoring stocks like Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia and have poured far more money into those names this year!  The exception is Apple. Retail traders have poured more than $1B into Apple stock since the end of November, or roughly a third of all money that went into Nasdaq stocks, according to Vanda Research.

"wait what... I didnt know this was down 5% today. Please give me brief explanation. What's the news, what happened?",1
So many lower gaps that should be filled. $680 is not out of the question.,0
"is that Gerb-dude, who slobbers all over Musk's nutsack, buying the dip after hours?",1
"when the macro is absolute dog shit, this isnt going to just bounce once the gap fills. I’ll likely hold my puts over the weekend.",1
"Elon Musk: Tesla plans to invest over $10 billion in Gigafactory Texas, employ 20,000 workers",0
"I love reading the thread on a great long term stock, around 70 percent of bear posts literally make me lol 30 percent of the bears aren't retarded and make me do more dd.  Either way Elon isn't a fake genius lmao. Can't wait to cash out in 30 years.",0
if this starts climbing and gets out of control it appears that the   bears could be getting hurt pretty badly. Elon always seems to be 2 steps ahead.  A lot of short volume,0
"im not sure why ppl are surprised, Elon is going to keep selling until he sells 17M shares total, probably has already sold 12ish according to forms tesla has to release, future you will appreciate accumulation, buy fear sell hype. Always find it funny how ppl say im going to buy the dip, then the dip comes and no one buys lol",0
🚨🚨WS Broken Math🚨🚨  Waiting for Form4s if any !!   So far that red box is getting uglier but SP is becoming dirt cheap !!   Math is practically broken - EPS is rising with delivery estimate but SP is falling -26% !   Same setup 3mons ago (in my posts) before we climbed 57% !!

$860 might be a good entry point..,1
man still 4 days to go at this rate. If he completes this year that’s 4 out of 10 trading days remaining!!,1
Most of his options were exercised at $930 support which means he acquired more shares than shares sold at low price  !!     🙏🏻🐉🦅👀,0
"relax people, this was 1k just this morning, buy more while it's resting, you know this beast will run again!!",0
still overvalued. I’ll start a small position at $835,1
"Elon:”so we sold 20k flamethrowers “   Host; flamethrowers?   Elon; “but they didn’t have to buy them, we were just trying to get a million cash . They didn’t have to buy them. They are very bad ideas.”  Host….”then why did you make them.”  Elon: “……. Next question lol “",1
lmao Elon selling… bears… he’s exercising options and selling half of them… every day he does this HE OWNS MORE SHARES LMAOOOOO,0
all Tesla Fanboys must be left in shambles!  Only way they will learn.,1
Elon the hustler. Sue him.,1
only if bears actually bought the dip to create generational wealth instead of playing options for pennies lol,0
you folks still think TSLA should be worth all other car makers combined with only like 1% of the cars sold?? Lol. This going to 100 quickly. And you guys believed Musk sold cause twitter followers told him too? He already scheduled the sales BEFORE that tweet. Followers always get hosed by their false gods.,1
ty Elon for dropping price with selling shares. This means I can buy buckets at discount,0

"I'm still favouring more downside today, the daily candle yesterday was horrible and I'd be amazed (but not surprised) if they took at back up to $1000 again without testing the previous ATH of $900 and completely filling the gap at $910.",0
"Musk is averaging around 900k shares sold per day, with about 4million left expect selling to conclude over the course of 4 trading days by year end. Usually been selling 1/2 days per week.",0
So Elon was selling more shares yesterday as per form 4 they released. Sold at average prices of $969 and $935  throughout the day. He still has around 4million or so shares to sell.,0
trading allowed only yesterday.  Window closed.  No new plan 🚀,0

Elon owns more stock now then when he first started selling.,0

Keep in mind Elon is in a battle with the Democrats over taxes.  To be spiteful he will keep selling shares,1
"Bears you realize by next week, you need to exit your puts and shorts….  Elon will be done selling and his total shares own will have grown  Happy you make money, buts it’s bull turn!!!  Let us all have a great Christmas.  So bears, turn to bulls by next week!!!",0

the mm's have been so smart in maintaining the appearance of a thriving market however its only been a handful or stocks that have actually been holding up the indices whilst the majority have been bleeding to new lows.  I think we will see a big (but slow) sell off in the mega caps that have been holding up the indices in the next few months.,1
If you see that Elon also sold today as well. Then you need to ask yourself what does he know that you don't? I don't think it's just Tesla. I think we are about to see a massive deleveraging across all markets. Smart money has already prepared.,1

"fear is out the way short term. Fed and quad witching over with. I “think” next week will be mostly bullish across the market heading into Christmas. I’ve traded both ways but I still believe big money has triggered a lot of price action over past few weeks. The sudden massive pops and drops, not just here but across the market weren’t natural and meant to shake up retail. I think it was more to milk options players of money than anything. So in reality market goes wherever the big money wants it to. A lot of money to be made both ways but if you got greedy you probably got burnt a time or two. Best of luck to both sides",0

"The chart belows shows Tesla's share price at the beginning of the Fed's pandemic QE.  Tesla's share price around the time the Fed began printing billions of dollars each month was around $85/share.  Imagine, when the Fed eliminates QE by March 2022.  Buy leap poots. The price action today was weak and showed that more institutional investors are begining to exit.  It barely closed green today.  On Monday, it will drop another $30 as it continues a downward trend.",1

The fact that this Administration is on active attack campaign against America top talents and one of the smartest innovators of our time  is very troubling and raises many questions about the integrity and the intention of such attackers and what good  would it do for  America ! ?   Look around seriously and see what these ppl have done -  career politicians lie about everything yet attacking America strongest assets .  instead of Cherish them protect them and help them out in implementing their vision to advance this country forward!!   This is very serious … as serious as someone working against US best interest !!   🙏🏻🐉🦅,0

Hmm. I’ll continue to stick with my bearish feelings on this one. Complete garbage & continues to bounce between the bottom of the 5 & the bottom bollinger band. Definitely not a place I’d like to be roaming as a bull. Terrible MFI & ADX on the daily. (In comments). Like I said earlier this week. Nothing could stop that train. Complete bull trap with that belt buckles PR drop whatever day that was.. Tuesday this week (?) that was dropped right at power hour to make the EOD run. You better hope for some support around the daily 100SMA but that weekly chart is screaming pullback to the 50SMA @ 770 at some point with that MACD going below the 0 on the daily like that. Oof. Tough road ahead.,1

BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Rivian, and VW all have EVs. With that said, there is no way to justify Tesla's current high valuation. Look for a downward trend as the valuation begins to deflate.",1

"🔥BREAKING NEWS - WHY NIO STOCK WILL HIT $40-$50 AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT🔥  NIO had between 40,000 and 70,000 Pre-Orders of their Flagship Vehicle, the NIO ET7. NIO announced on Sunday that the newly revealed NIO ET5 has surpassed any other NIO Vehicle on Pre-Order numbers. This means that the NIO ET5 got over 40,000 to 70,000 Pre-Orders in only 1 day as the vehicle was just revealed at their annual NIO Day this past Saturday.  It is said that each NIO sales person got around 15-20 orders alone not including online pre-orders. Some customers were not able to place a Pre-Order as the systems were either slow or crashing from all the Orders. This is truly amazing as this shows how popular the NIO ET5 will be and the large amount of sales it will have.  Remember, this was updated yesterday so by now the preorder number could be 100,000 Vehicle in just a few days. Look out for a NIO announcement this or in the coming weeks.

news has been incredibly bullish lately and stock continues to get drilled. This is a horrible scenario for bulls moving forward. All good news is baked in and the market doesn’t give a fuck. Consider that before you start “buying the dip.” This is exactly what they mean when they say hope is not a strategy. Bulls are currently HOPING the market all of a sudden reverses on old news 🤣🤣🤣 easiest short in the market.,1
Added 2 more pairs of bull put spread around 780 region. I definitely don't see tsla dropping below 800. And most likely tsla will remain above 900 by end of week.  Go go go,0

"""I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here,"" 'What Was I Supposed To Do?' Says Elon Musk When Asked About Tesla  Stock Selling, Adds He Sold 'Enough' Stock      Musk sold another 583,611 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) on Tuesday, according to filings.  This brings the total number of shares sold to 13.5 million, which is around 80% of what he promised he will sell on Twitter. Out of 13.5 million, 8.06 million of Tesla shares were sold to pay taxes that are connected to the exercise of his option.",0
the man is a genius. wouldn’t be surprised musk threw the 10% news out there to throw shorts off he knew he would only sell about 7% but the extra 3% would be the short squeeze lfg 🚀🦍🦍,0
"In an interview with the satirical website Babylon Bee, Musk said he sold “enough” Tesla stock as he approaches the 10% threshold.  ""I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here,"" he said in the interview with satirical website Babylon Bee.  Musk added that he needed to exercise stock options “no matter what” and that he has also sold an additional ""incremental stock"" to get near 10%.  In the same interview, Musk also said that he didn’t pay any taxes in 2018 but that he “accidentally” overpaid in 2017. The only way for him to pay taxes, given that he gets no salary or bonus from Tesla, was to sell stock.  “What was I supposed to do?” he said as there is no mechanism to pay the tax as he gets no income.",0
it would be funny if Musk sells more shares today.,1
"let me guess ... Elon's farts don't stink either ... that should be good for another share price increase of 200 bucks at $tsla 🤡 ... just pay your taxes and stfu #elon ... rest assured your overpriced p o s TESLA soon trades sub 800, dramatically lower thereafter 🐻❤😈✔",1

we close over 1010.,0
waiting for a drop below 940 then we can re-evaluate. This could go back into the 800s within 2 months or sooner.  Remember Elon can’t sell the remainder until after Jan 28. Feb:March will see the selling pressure we witnessed. And that’s just before the FED completely ends the market stimulus and raises rates.  Plenty of opportunity to get back in much cheaper than the current stock price. Patience also means you’ve got to wait for a decent entry - this stock is still way overvalued.,1

Musk is such a wretched POS for what he did today. What is even more egregious is not having an SEC that actually does something about it. This blatant securities fraud no matter how you slice it.

he has a target on his back so he speaks in veiled terms in relation to his stock movements. I’m order to avoid  accusations of manipulation he says he’s sold enough to cover his 10% ( I’m paraphrasing) and then says he could sell more for next year or something to that affect. The statement of “ covering his 10%” is the signal of IM DONE,0

soo anyone know if that article claiming he sold again yesterday is legit ? Claiming his total is now 15.4 billion. If so than we might rally more than I thought short term.

chances are 10B5-1 sales are finished. Last batch involved exercise of 1.55 million options which requires about 690k shares to be sold to cover withholding tax.

"not  really off topic, but I live in LA. there are so many Teslas in LA its pretty amazing to see so many and how fast they’ve proliferated. It’s seems equal to the number of Toyotas Hondas, Benz’s, etc. Maybe I see it more because they’re so recognizable.  They  do look great. The sleek upper scale ones are beautiful and Even the lower tier 3 has a great look.  They’re  more of high tier ones  here but that might be because the 3 is considerably newer. But so many Tesla’s here. If that was to to become the case everywhere , the sales would surpass GM. I don’t think they came out w their truck yet either.

This see if I’m right again.   It closed on a Flag. We could very well see $1100 by open Monday. If there’s not a weekend of omicron fear mongering. If so, we retest $1030 support. If $1030 support holds I’ll be buying $1100 12/31 calls there. If we open at $1100 I’ll be buying $1050p for the quick morning dip then flipping back to calls.  I see a lot of new Christmas money entering into the markets next week to continue the 🎅🏽 rally.   Merry Christmas Eve everyone!",0

@willPessimisticBull the token price and share price have no correlation though. Buying the token is not buying a part of the company like buying a share is. Just think of the token as a product the company is selling.  is just over $1k but sells cars that cost more than $1k.,0

Electric vehicles are unaffordable, and widely unattainable why is this?   Because Elon Musk is relying the exploitation of 40,000 children to make up for the Mutanda mine being closed.

"LCID has the best management and engineers with a lot of experience. The LCID car has already been selected as the vehicle of the year 2022. This vehicle has the greatest range as well as the best charging efficiency. LCID has received tremendous support from wealthy Saudi Arabian investors, and they have a substantial amount of cash (approximately 6.5 billion dollars). So, what makes you all believe that this is not the future of Tesla? I went back and looked at the Tesla chart once more. Tesla was selling for less than $100 last year, but look at where the price of Tesla has risen to. I completely understand everyone's desire to keep pushing and see the growth of their stock. However, I strongly encourage you to take a moment to consider joining the LCID rid. Again, I am not claiming that the prices of LCID and Tesla will be the same next year, but I am confident that both of these companies will grow significantly. Please refer the chart for Tesla price last year",0

might nibble a bit at 35...not sure though,1
I knew this was bad PIZZA  when it fell below the IPO price,1
this just keeps going down. Bad management. New CEO is the definition of wile racism and terrorism. Twtr has Failed to monetize the website. Losing account followers by alienating free speech principles. Advertising dollars are leery. Most of all by banning Trump they have enabled DWAC to be successful. With the billion dollar PIPE for Dwac and the return in AH of DWAC to near $60 share price - all a consequence of stupid management moves by Twtr. The future looks more and more like a tiny segmented group of MSNBC watchers - that’s fine but the could have been fox news which dominates ratings by double MSNBC. It’s like management doesn’t give a shit about making $$ or their shareholders.,1
useless stinky curry ass CEO,1
CEO seems like a woke puppet,1
"When will shareholders sue management for malfeasance?  How much money has Twitter spent playing politics instead of building a business?   Run and hide, Dorkey.",1
Bwahahahaha!!!  Trading below it's IPO price 8 years later as this company bans its own revenue base because they're leftists trash.  Figures.  Glad I do not own this turd.,1

"Another example of when Cathie Wood buys, you must sell or short immediately.  Probably the most undisciplined trader ever.   Stock is below 20, 50, 200 days and the low of the year.  There is no Anchored VWAP support anywhere near the current level and no volume shelf.  It is December when year end tax loss selling will kick in.  With Dorsey out, this stock will be back to the 30's by end of the year.",1

did Dorsey just sell his reaming shares to buy crypto?,1

fake out. Don’t buy this essentially zero growth sinking ship. They’ve made a great argument for avoiding their platform altogether. Why do you think Dorsey bailed? Timber in this piece of trash.,1
good price to short. Can make a few bucks by mid week.,1
long run is very bearish here. This has never consistently been above IPO amount 8 years ago. Advertising $ have been turned off by the management decisions banning accounts photos etc. Management’s failure to monetize the website better after 8 years is telling. The new CEO has made it possible for competition to become significant.,1

You have to be crazy to invest in this pos. There best earnings per quarter this year is .078 per share. They lost .67 per share last quarter with a 33 billion dollar market cap. The good news if you sell now you can still clam a tax loss for this year.,1

: read my recent posts to decide whether I’m worth your trust. The pullbacks are just noise and are 100% buying opportunities. Upgrades from hold to buy even at similar PT’s will catapult this stock.

@Crypto_king_  I think you've been conditioned to think most right wingers are obsessed with Trump.

Go buy  or some other company that pushes censorship so you all can all goo goo gah gah over your leaders that are currently running our country into the ground.

"...and another fact from their earnings release is that they ""purposely reduced third-party advertising advertising in favor of promoted listings"". This is from 10/28 earnings PR.  That is your reason for a dramatic sales plunge for sellers worldwide. The plan to have sellers use ""promoted listings"" is back-firing. Yes, they generate money from promoted listing, BUT, only when an item sells. Sales have dropped dramatically, so where are the revenues from promoted listings to come from?  We promote 95%-98% of all our items on ebay and virtually no sales in the last 3 weeks. We've been selling on ebay since 1998 and have 100% positive feedback and have never seen a drop in sales like this before. Horrible decision by management!

this is moving to $3000. This is primed and read maybe a short pull back to $2950. As long as futures are good. We can expect a break of $3000 this week or early next.

"smashes through its Singles Day record with $48.7 billion in sales and counting. Chinese e-commerce giant JD has racked up 311.4 billion yuan ($48.6 billion) in sales across its platforms as of 14:09 p.m. Beijing time during the Singles Day shopping event, smashing through its record last year.  The figure JD released is referred to as transaction volume. It is the amount of money that is transacted across its e-commerce platforms and does not directly translate into revenue for the company — and it does not take into account returned items.  Still, it’s an indication of the appetite from shoppers on Singles Day or Double 11, a major shopping event in China that eclipses Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S. in terms of sales.",0

no major surprises on the earnings call other than highlighting their best in class supply chains which are ensuring they continue to perform for their customers in this challenging environment. Q4 outlook is positive and will see strong seasonal demand somewhat similar to the H1 this year. All in all a good solid quarter and the business growth and user growth still very strong. I didn't hear any questions in the GAAP loss so don't have an explanation for that. Hope someone out there with an accounting background can look into that.,0

My perception is that even among a big portion of educated people they see China as waaaay more primitive then they really are. When I see these remarkable societies/cities it just feels INSANE we have such a hard time catching a break at these valuations. Even with all FUD and the CCP being a bunch of unpleasant, comically easily offended and super un-smooth operators (my opinion).

"Will JD Be Worth More Than Tesla by 2032? Over the next decade, it seems likely JDs value will increase significantly, even with the headwinds of closer regulatory scrutiny, simply because the genie of online shopping can't ever be put back in the bottle. The internet retailer is an integral part of the Chinese economy, and breaking that bond would be disastrous for everyone.  Can it gain Tesla-like heights? While becoming a trillion-dollar company seems hard to imagine, even over the next decade, a combination of Tesla having a more down-to-earth valuation, coupled with JD's own value growing, makes it quite possible, even likely, that the e-commerce leader could be worth more than the EV maker.",0

The phones are, IMHO, quite nice in appearance and performance.  Integration is the Key.  No other TECH company on the planet can match Google .

@SirFibonacci Have you considered taking a step back and finding a correlation between the stocks that went down after earnings and then going back and seeing how and why  clearly did not fit?

Im a bull playing short term bear but i also want you to see how big of a fake pump this really is today lol  Thursday high to Friday Low - 391.74 👉🏽378.90 (-3.3%) took 189.7 mil in volume  Monday low to Tuesday high - 379.30 👉🏽 397.48 (+4.7%) took 84.4 mil in volume   There is nothing organic about this day whatsoever",1
"I’d be more concerned as a bull trying to decide when to close monthly calls than a bear trying to decide when to close monthly puts. I’d be picking more puts here above $396.33 as we just cleared 2 fib levels in 24 hours on 50% volume. If a bull would like to try and make sense of that for me, I’d be glad to listen.    That opening gap today is also ridiculous. And inflation data Friday morning is my guess for this low volume pump to start the week.   Those Powell Puts  already gave you clues about inflation and where it’s going last time he spoke",1

We have serious delays in shipping, and I just don't see the markets benefiting well from a Santa Clause rally this year when there's not enough product on store shelves to meet expected consumer demand and no demand for said products because people are just hoarding more money nowadays due to fear of disease, war, inflation etc...

Anything under $393 is a death trap. $40 drop from there. Anything over $398 is incredibly bullish & we will see a blow off top. That is why we’re trading sideways here.

"Giving 50% weighting to each of the methods we used, we think Starbucks' fair value is $88.5 and adding a 30% margin of safety to it, we will be a happy buyer of the firm at below $61 per share.

Using a terminal growth rate of 6% with 10% as the discount rate, the calculated intrinsic value will be $95.5bn, which is $80.9 converting to per-share value.  PE method The stock is currently trading at 31.9x PE which is 1sd above its 5-year average of 27.4x and we are not seeing any justifiable reason for this premium right now. The 5-year average PE implied price is $96.2 which is implying a 15% downside from here.",1

You can't lose money if you profit every year and TSM has done that for me for 4 years straight. Up 202% and that is not to bad . Just my opinion",0

mass hysteria frenzy whipped up by the media because a new variant of covid has been discovered. But we all know the virus mutates and will likely do so for many years to come. Big Pharma have already stated that the vaccine will most likely protect but they'll know much more within 2 weeks at the most. Markets were looking for an excuse to sell off and the media gave them just that. Baba and JD are probably the 2 best ecommerce stocks to own during a covid crisis so their selling was even more ridiculous. Both these will be 15% higher by end of December.,0

They have a plan and I have a feeling its unravelling before our very eyes. Let's delist Didi and test the process. If all goes well, we'll bring them all home. Didi is the bad boy who listed without permission so they get it the hard way. The rest will likely follow once the markets get accustomed to the idea. So smart the Chinese. Winning again.",0

"last earnings report was AWESOME. Big growth continues year over year and there is simply no sign of it stopping.   Since that time, the stock has fallen 27 points.    And NOW, the company has announced an increase to their share buyback plans of 50% in response to that.   They know a great stock deal when they see it. Their OWN stock.  Stock buybacks at very attractive prices is a hallmark of what Warren Buffet has done with Berkshire Hathaway over the decades.

"""The 5G market was lead by Qualcomm, despite the supply chain issues. Qualcomm managed to grab a massive 62% share of chips with the NR connectivity primarily because it was able to get dual contractors for manufacturing of key components, including its Snapdragon 8-series chips, as well as the premium 5G modems.  The massive increase was also driven by the seasonal demand for new iPhones as Apple launched the iPhone 13 series in September, for which Qualcomm supplies the modems.""  ""Qualcomm grew 9% sequentially due to dual sourcing from foundries. It dominated the 5G baseband modem shipments with a 62% share. The refreshed portfolio in the Snapdragon 7, 6 and 4 series will further help it gain share in Q4 2021.""",0

"TSMC said it expects the global semiconductor industry to show compound annual growth of more than 10 percent from this year to 2025, outpacing growth of 7 percent in the five years to last year and 3 percent from 2000 to 2015.  To seize this opportunity, TSMC is approximately doubling the pace of its capacity expansion from this year to 2023, compared with the three years to last year, Chin said.",0

"if you want stocks that fly to the moon TSM is not for you. 90% of stocks will disappoint,  so good luck finding that fly to the moon stock. TSM is a stock that just keeps growing. Sometimes in months and yes years but grow it will. I bought 3 and a half years ago for 39 and it grew as you can see. 195 % in that time makes me happy. So I am ok not saying to the moon",0

"@Vol888 @ljganz Here's my chart. I sold covered calls right at the top of the channel this week and it worked perfectly. I'm also hoping for a breakout or at least another test of $123, but would argue  is more of a sideways channel than wedge at this point.",0

@PajamaTrader come to  it tried to breakout on Monday but then the macro market dragged it back down. I think it retests very soon,0
"could be a red to green day with other semis turning positive, though TSM usually gets left behind",0
at good support. He’s ready 👌✌️👍,0
in small call position here for next week,0
"the hedgies are making fucking sure to put the price down under $120.  The price went over $120 so many times today and asa that happened, it got dragged back down to $119.  the hedgies are sorting viciously and probably by illegal dark pool.  fuck them.  I will hold my shares and buy more whenever i can!",0
we bouce here. At weekly 9 ema and retested breakout on weekly as well. We going higher boys hold on tight💰this is an obvious long play. 200$ by june,0
sold half of the shares. Bought AMD and NVDA instead 👍,0

pretty disgusted with this week honestly. Breakout Monday then collapse. Im still holding leaps but wtf,0
"Hedgies try to shake off the tsm retail investors. They know how to use emotions and impatiences of retail investors. :) thanks to amc and gamestop,  i am smarter now.  I will hold and buy more whenever I can. I will not sell tsm shares. Anyway, happy Thanksgiving everyone!",0

Great to see this move.  Over 125 and the fireworks start.,0
cmon it's time to catch up to AMD and NVDA,0
"this is my number one stock, in since 39. Not a flashy stock but it's a very profitable one for me. Love their dividend plus up 200%. Very satisfied so I will never say anything bad about it.",0
"there are multiple patterns happening on TSM. Wedge, head and shoulders, and a long consolidation period. Any failed bear pattern turns into a bullish pattern. Interesting chart to keep on watch for this week. Chip sector is hot so I’m leaning towards calls.",0
should be $140,0
"event friday, and divedends on the 16th.  We may finally break out soon",0
Q4 and Q1 2022 about to be massive $140+,0
this thing is gonna rip right back up to 123 here after 122,0

took a long position in TSM yesterday with March calls.  Weekly chart has a massive base and looks ready for a move up.   I front ran this a little but a move above $124 it can really fly.  Also considering shorter dated calls above this level.,0
18.7% YoY revenue increase for November,0
I've been stocking up on puts. I think this is a great company but when China hits Taiwan this thing will probably drop 80%.  The pieces are all lining up. It's shocking that so many people don't see the great risk associated with this company.,1
"this things is only held down by threat of china invasion. when (if) that diminishes, will explode. plus they are building factories overseas. HODL for years",0
need you over 120 and say goodbye to 119 forever. TsM worth 150 at least.,0
red to green move. Im liking $125 calls,0
picked up Jan 120/130 call spreads today - decent relative strength,0
my game plan today is if this can’t hold 280 I’ll sell my calls for an L and look for an entry on puts as 270-268 are downside targets for me.,0
The best semiconductor company in the world. I believe in them 5 years ago when I bought at 39 and I believe in them now and will hold at least 5 more years maybe more. I never thought it would get to 100 but now I believe it will reach 400 by 2023. Just my opinion,0
will get back to the 120's by Tuesday,0
good upside once they csb start meeting supply again,0
holding shares for long time,0

"this wasn't the best year, only 8% profit but had lots of problems with the China thing going on and chip shortages. Great companies can overcome problems and still profit. I am very confident my profits will be way above 8% next year. I am about the end result not day to day. You can't lose money if you profit every year and TSM has done that for me for 4 years straight. Up 202% and that is not to bad . Just my opinion",0
57x free cash flow to market cap ratio.....this is a expensive motherfucker....sure 10.5B in free cash flow this year but there are much cheaper plays out there that will be profitable....sorry guys this is way WAY over valued....,1
undervalued. This is a long term plan imo. But it’s safe,0
